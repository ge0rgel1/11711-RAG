Abstract: ABSTRACT It’s critical to foster artificial intelligence (AI) literacy for high school students, the first generation to grow up surrounded by AI, to understand working mechanism of data-driven AI technologies and critically evaluate automated decisions from predictive models. While efforts have been made to engage youth in understanding AI through developing machine learning models, few provided in-depth insights into the nuanced learning processes. In this study, we examined high school students’ data modeling practices and processes. Twenty-eight students developed machine learning models with text data for classifying negative and positive reviews of ice cream stores. We identified nine data modeling practices that describe students’ processes of model exploration, development, and testing and two themes about evaluating automated decisions from data technologies. The results provide implications for designing accessible data modeling experiences for students to understand data justice as well as the role and responsibility of data modelers in creating AI technologies.

Abstract: Recent work has demonstrated the positive impact of incorporating linguistic representations as additional context and scaffolds on the in-domain performance of several NLP tasks. We extend this work by exploring the impact of linguistic representations on cross-domain performance in a few-shot transfer setting. An important question is whether linguistic representations enhance generalizability by providing features that function as cross-domain pivots. We focus on the task of relation extraction on three datasets of procedural text in two domains, cooking and materials science. Our approach augments a popular transformer-based architecture by alternately incorporating syntactic and semantic graphs constructed by freely available off-the-shelf tools. We examine their utility for enhancing generalization, and investigate whether earlier findings, e.g. that semantic representations can be more helpful than syntactic ones, extend to relation extraction in multiple domains. We find that while the inclusion of these graphs results in significantly higher performance in few-shot transfer, both types of graph exhibit roughly equivalent utility.

Abstract: In quantitative question answering, compositional generalization is one of the main challenges of state of the art models, especially when longer sequences of reasoning steps are required. In this paper we propose CounterComp, a method that uses counterfactual scenarios to generate samples with compositional contrast. Instead of a data augmentation approach, CounterComp is based on metric learning, which allows for direct sampling from the training set and circumvents the need for additional human labels. Our proposed auxiliary metric learning loss improves the performance of three state of the art models on four recently released datasets. We also show how the approach can improve OOD performance on unseen domains, as well as unseen compositions. Lastly, we demonstrate how the method can lead to better compositional attention patterns during training.

Abstract: By aligning the functional components derived from the activations of transformer models trained for AES with external knowledge such as human-understandable feature groups, the proposed method improves the interpretability of a Longformer Automatic Essay Scoring (AES) system and provides tools for performing such analyses on further neural AES systems. The analysis focuses on models trained to score essays based on organization, main idea, support, and language. The findings provide insights into the models’ decision-making processes, biases, and limitations, contributing to the development of more transparent and reliable AES systems.

Abstract: Exploring Artificial Intelligence (AI) in English Language Arts (ELA) with StoryQ is a 10-hour curriculum module designed for high school ELA classes. The module introduces students to fundamental AI concepts and essential machine learning workflow using StoryQ, a web-based GUI environment for Grades 6-12 learners. In this module, students work with unstructured text data and learn to train, test, and improve text classification models such as intent recognition, clickbait filter, and sentiment analysis. As they interact with machine-learning language models deeply, students also gain a nuanced understanding of language and how to wield it, not just as a data structure, but as a tool in our human-human encounters as well. The current version contains eight lessons, all delivered through a full-featured online learning and teaching platform. Computers and Internet access are required to implement the module. The module was piloted in an ELA class in the Spring of 2022, and the student learning outcomes were positive. The module is currently undergoing revision and will be further tested and improved in Fall 2022.

Abstract: Quality assurance (QA) is an essential though underdeveloped part of the data annotation process. Although QA is supported to some extent in existing annotation tools, comprehensive support for QA is not standardly provided. In this paper we contribute QA4IE, a comprehensive QA tool for information extraction, which can (1) detect potential problems in text annotations in a timely manner, (2) accurately assess the quality of annotations, (3) visually display and summarize annotation discrepancies among annotation team members, (4) provide a comprehensive statistics report, and (5) support viewing of annotated documents interactively. This paper offers a competitive analysis comparing QA4IE and other popular annotation tools and demonstrates its features, usage, and effectiveness through a case study. The Python code, documentation, and demonstration video are available publicly at https://github.com/CC-RMD-EpiBio/QA4IE.

Abstract: Extracting temporal relationships between pairs of events in texts is a crucial yet challenging problem for natural language understanding. Depending on the distance between the events, models must learn to differently balance information from local and global contexts surrounding the event pair for temporal relation prediction. Learning how to fuse this information has proved challenging for transformer-based language models. Therefore, we present MulCo: Multi-Scale Contrastive Co-Training, a technique for the better fusion of local and global contextualized features. Our model uses a BERT-based language model to encode local context and a Graph Neural Network (GNN) to represent global document-level syntactic and temporal characteristics. Unlike previous state-of-the-art methods, which use simple concatenation on multi-view features or select optimal sentences using sophisticated reinforcement learning approaches, our model co-trains GNN and BERT modules using a multi-scale contrastive learning objective. The GNN and BERT modules learn a synergistic parameterization by contrasting GNN multi-layer multi-hop subgraphs (i.e., global context embeddings) and BERT outputs (i.e., local context embeddings) through end-to-end back-propagation. We empirically demonstrate that MulCo provides improved ability to fuse local and global contexts encoded using BERT and GNN compared to the current state-of-the-art. Our experimental results show that MulCo achieves new state-of-the-art results on several temporal relation extraction datasets.

Abstract: People speaking different kinds of languages search for information in a cross-lingual manner. They tend to ask questions in their language and expect the answer to be in the same language, despite the evidence lying in another language. In this paper, we present our approach for this task of cross-lingual open-domain question-answering. Our proposed method employs a passage reranker, the fusion-in-decoder technique for generation, and a wiki data entity-based post-processing system to tackle the inability to generate entities across all languages. Our end-2-end pipeline shows an improvement of 3 and 4.6 points on F1 and EM metrics respectively, when compared with the baseline CORA model on the XOR-TyDi dataset. We also evaluate the effectiveness of our proposed techniques in the zero-shot setting using the MKQA dataset and show an improvement of 5 points in F1 for high-resource and 3 points improvement for low-resource zero-shot languages. Our team, CMUmQA’s submission in the MIA-Shared task ranked 1st in the constrained setup for the dev and 2nd in the test setting.

Abstract: This paper presents high school students’ sense-making of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) before and after they participated in a three-week technology-enhanced AI curriculum experience. We analyzed students’ pre-and-post assessment responses, responses to activity-specific questions, and classroom video recordings to explore their understanding of AI and ML. Our analysis revealed that students’ AI and ML conceptions shifted from media-informed concepts and presuppositions to more structured and process-oriented understandings after they completed AI curriculum modules. Our ongoing and future work aims to develop a deeper understanding of how students’ sense-making of AI and ML is influenced by their prior knowledge, experiences, and perspectives as well as the curriculum activities, tasks, and resources.
- Qinlan Shen, C. Rosé. 2022. A Tale of Two Subreddits: Measuring the Impacts of Quarantines on Political Engagement on Reddit. Abstract: Concerns over the spread of abusive content in social media have led online platforms to explore large scale community-level forms of moderation.
As an alternative to full bans, Reddit has implemented quarantines of subreddits, limiting access to controversial communities without explicit removal.
Previous evaluations of the effectiveness of quarantines have focused on their impact on toxicity in affected communities.
In this work, however, we focus on examining the impacts of quarantines of political subreddits on issues of political engagement in the broader Reddit community.
We present a case study of two ideologically distinct political subreddits, r/The_Donald and r/ChapoTrapHouse, and examine the impact of quarantines on activity, visibility, and political discussion.
We find that while quarantines had a homogenizing effect on participation in political subreddits, they had limited impact on the visibility of community-internal issues and political language, due to the entrenchment of subreddit norms.

Abstract: The CODI-CRAC 2022 Shared Task on Anaphora Resolution in Dialogues is the second edition of an initiative focused on detecting different types of anaphoric relations in conversations of different kinds. Using five conversational datasets, four of which have been newly annotated with a wide range of anaphoric relations: identity, bridging references and discourse deixis, we defined multiple tasks focusing individually on these key relations. The second edition of the shared task maintained the focus on these relations and used the same datasets as in 2021, but new test data were annotated, the 2021 data were checked, and new subtasks were added. In this paper, we discuss the annotation schemes, the datasets, the evaluation scripts used to assess the system performance on these tasks, and provide a brief summary of the participating systems and the results obtained across 230 runs from three teams, with most submissions achieving significantly better results than our baseline methods.

Collaborative Programming for Work-Relevant Learning: Comparing Programming Practice With Example-Based Reflection for Student Learning and Transfer Task Performance. Abstract: Computer science pedagogy, especially in the higher education and vocational training context, has long-favored the hands-on practice provided by programming tasks due to the belief that this leads to better performance on hands-on tasks at work. This assumption, however, has not been experimentally tested against other modes of engagement such as worked example-based reflection. While theory suggests that example-based reflection could be better for conceptual learning, the concern is that the lack of practice will leave students unable to implement the learned concepts in practice, thus leaving them unprepared for work. In this article, therefore, we experimentally contrast programming practice with example-based reflection to observe their differential impact on conceptual learning and performance on a hands-on task in the context of a collaborative programming project. The industry paradigm of Mob Programming, adapted for use in an online and instructional context, is used to structure the collaboration. Keeping with the prevailing view held in pedagogy, we hypothesize that example-based reflection will lead to better conceptual learning but will be detrimental to hands-on task performance. Results support that reflection leads to conceptual learning. Additionally, however, reflection does not pose an impediment to hands-on task performance. We discuss possible explanations for this effect, thus providing an improved understanding of prior theory in this new computer science education context. We also discuss implications for the pedagogy of software engineering education, in light of this new evidence, that impacts student learning as well as work performance in the future.
- Qi Wang, C. Rosé, Ning Ma, Shiyan Jiang, Haogang Bao, Yanyan Li. 2022. Design and Application of Automatic Feedback Scaffolding in Forums to Promote Learning. Abstract: Forums are essential components facilitating interactions in online courses. However, in large-scale courses, many posts generated, which results in learners’ difficulties. First, the posts are poorly organized and some deviate from the topic, making it difficult for learners’ knowledge acquisition. Second, learners cannot receive timely feedback and guidance, making the learning progress unclear for them. Well-designed scaffoldings should be built based on challenges of forums to improve learners’ learning outcomes, knowledge construction, and completion rate. While targeting the problems in online forums, this article proposed principles for the design of online scaffolding after analyzing the requirements of online learning scaffolding or scripts. Subsequently, in this article, we designed an automatic feedback scaffolding based on the principles and a knowledge construction model. The scaffolding provided learners with timely feedback and related learning guidance. Tags were used to assist learners in acquiring relevant information more easily. The scaffolding was then integrated into the Learning Cell Knowledge Community and used in an online course for 955 learners. The results showed that automatic feedback scaffolding positively affected learners’ learning and promoted positive knowledge transformation. Furthermore, we found that the scaffolding could help learners induce more constructive behaviors defined in the Interactive, Constructive, Active, and Passive deep learning framework that demonstrated the reason for learners’ knowledge transformation. At last, learners’ course completion rate also increased with the help of the scaffolding, which provided evidence that well-designed scaffolding can result in positive educational outcomes. In addition, the principles proposed could also contribute to further scaffolding design and practices.

StoryQ: A Web-Based Machine Learning and Text Mining Tool for K-12 Students. Abstract: StoryQ is a web-based machine learning and text mining tool that allows young learners (Grade 6-12) to engage in machine learning practices and work with unstructured text data without coding. StoryQ features dynamically linked data representations that promote meaningful inquiries across tables, graphs, and texts--a unique user experience that makes machine learning models transparent, explainable, and fun to explore. This demo provides a brief tutorial on how to use StoryQ to train, test, and troubleshoot text classification models using both standard feature extractors (e.g., N-grams) and special feature extraction tools and visualizations designed to support young learners and non-computing teachers. This demo also includes sample learning activities designed for high school English Language Arts classes to showcase how machine learning concepts and practices can be introduced in non-computing classes. This work is supported by an NSF I-TEST project (DRL-1949110).
- Armineh Nourbakhsh, Cathy Jiao, Sameena Shah, C. Rosé. 2022. Improving compositional generalization for multi-step quantitative reasoning in question answering. Abstract: Quantitative reasoning is an important aspect of question answering, especially when numeric and verbal cues interact to indicate sophisticated, multi-step programs. In this paper, we demonstrate how modeling the compositional nature of quantitative text can enhance the performance and robustness of QA models, allowing them to capture arithmetic logic that is expressed verbally. Borrowing from the literature on semantic parsing, we propose a method that encourages the QA models to adjust their attention patterns and capture input/output alignments that are meaningful to the reasoning task. We show how this strategy improves program accuracy and renders the models more robust against overfitting as the number of reasoning steps grows. Our approach is designed as a standalone module which can be prepended to many existing models and trained in an end-to-end fashion without the need for additional supervisory signal. As part of this exercise, we also create a unified dataset building on four previously released numerical QA datasets over tabular data.

Teach Artificial Intelligence with StoryQ, A Web-Based Machine Learning and Text Mining Tool for K-12 Students. Abstract: StoryQ is a web-based machine learning and text mining tool that allows young learners (Grade 6-12) to engage in machine learning practices and work with unstructured text data without needing to code. StoryQ features dynamically linked data representations that promote meaningful inquiries and understandings across tables, graphs, and texts. These links create a unique user experience that makes machine learning models transparent, explainable, and fun to explore. This demo will showcase how key AI concepts such as representation, reasoning, feature space, feature weight, and machine learning are dynamically visualized in StoryQ and made accessible to young learners. A brief tutorial will be provided on how to use StoryQ to train, test, and troubleshoot text classification models using both standard feature extractors (e.g., N-grams) and special feature extraction tools and visualizations that have been specially designed to support young learners and non-computing teachers. This demo will also include sample learning activities designed for high school English Language Arts and History classes to showcase how machine learning concepts and practices can be introduced in non-computing classes. As the demands for AI scientists, engineers, and entrepreneurs have increased in recent years, as well as AI's increased presence in everyday lives, making access to how machine learning practices work is of paramount importance for young learners. This work is supported by an NSF ITEST project (DRL-1949110).
- Justin Lovelace, C. Rosé. 2022. A Framework for Adapting Pre-Trained Language Models to Knowledge Graph Completion. Abstract: Recent work has demonstrated that entity representations can be extracted from pre-trained language models to develop knowledge graph completion models that are more robust to the naturally occurring sparsity found in knowledge graphs. In this work, we conduct a comprehensive exploration of how to best extract and incorporate those embeddings into knowledge graph completion models. We explore the suitability of the extracted embeddings for direct use in entity ranking and introduce both unsupervised and supervised processing methods that can lead to improved downstream performance. We then introduce supervised embedding extraction methods that can extract more informative representations. We then synthesize our findings and develop a knowledge graph completion model that significantly outperforms recent neural models.
- Sumit Agarwal, Rosa Vitiello, C. Rosé. 2022. Model Transfer for Event tracking as Transcript Understanding for Videos of Small Group Interaction. Abstract: Videos of group interactions contain a wealth of information beyond the information directly communicated in a transcript of the discussion. Tracking who has participated throughout an extended interaction and what each of their trajectories has been in relation to one another is the foundation for joint activity understanding, though it comes with some unique challenges in videos of tightly coupled group work. Motivated by insights into the properties of such scenarios, including group composition and the properties of task-oriented, goal directed tasks, we present a successful proof-of-concept. In particular, we present a transfer experiment to a dyadic robot construction task, an ablation study, and a qualitative analysis.

Abstract: We present a script for conversational reflection guidance embedded in reflective practice. Rebo Junior, a nonadaptive conversational agent, was evaluated in a 12-week field study with apprentices. We analyzed apprentices’ interactions with Rebo Junior in terms of reflectivity and measured the development of their reflection competence via reflective essays at three points in time during the field study. Reflection competence, a key competency for lifelong professional learning, becomes significantly higher by the third essay after repeated interactions with Rebo Junior (paired samples t-test t13 = 3.00, p = 0.010 from Essay 1 to Essay 3). However, we also observed a significant decrease in reflectivity in the Rebo Junior interactions over time (paired samples t-test between the first and eighth interaction: t7 = 2.50, p = 0.041). We attribute this decline to 1) the novelty of Rebo Junior wearing off (novelty effect) and 2) the apprentices learning the script and experiencing subsequent frustration due to the script not fading over time. Overall, this work 1) informs future design through the observation of consistent decreases in engagement over eight interactions with static scaffolding, 2) contributes a reflection script applicable for reflection on tasks that resemble future expected work tasks, a typical setting in lifelong professional learning, and 3) indicates increased reflection competence after repeated reflection guided by a conversational agent.
- James Fiacco, Shiyan Jiang, David Adamson, C. Rosé. 2022. Toward Automatic Discourse Parsing of Student Writing Motivated by Neural Interpretation. Abstract: Providing effective automatic essay feedback is necessary for offering writing instruction at a massive scale. In particular, feedback for promoting coherent flow of ideas in essays is critical. In this paper we propose a state-of-the-art method for automated analysis of structure and flow of writing, referred to as Rhetorical Structure Theory (RST) parsing. In so doing, we lay a foundation for a generalizable approach to automated writing feedback related to structure and flow. We address challenges in automated rhetorical analysis when applied to student writing and evaluate our novel RST parser model on both a recent student writing dataset and a standard benchmark RST parsing dataset.
- Luke Breitfeller, Aakanksha Naik, C. Rosé. 2021. STAGE: Tool for Automated Extraction of Semantic Time Cues to Enrich Neural Temporal Ordering Models. Abstract: Despite achieving state-of-the-art accuracy on temporal ordering of events, neural models showcase significant gaps in performance. Our work seeks to fill one of these gaps by leveraging an under-explored dimension of textual semantics: rich semantic information provided by explicit textual time cues. We develop STAGE, a system that consists of a novel temporal framework and a parser that can automatically extract time cues and convert them into representations suitable for integration with neural models. We demonstrate the utility of extracted cues by integrating them with an event ordering model using a joint BiLSTM and ILP constraint architecture. We outline the functionality of the 3-part STAGE processing approach, and show two methods of integrating its representations with the BiLSTM-ILP model: (i) incorporating semantic cues as additional features, and (ii) generating new constraints from semantic cues to be enforced in the ILP. We demonstrate promising results on two event ordering datasets, and highlight important issues in semantic cue representation and integration for future research.

Abstract: We present our pipelined approach for the sub-task of anaphora resolution in chemical patents as part of the ChEMU shared task at CLEF, 2021. Our approach consists of independently trained mention extraction and relation classification modules. For the former, we set up a BERT-CRF and leverage the BIO scheme to represent the mentions. We include a post-processing step after mention extraction to correct boundary errors and handle nested mentions. For relation classification, we develop a BERT-based model that captures the context between the two candidate mentions to predict the relation between the two. Our final submission ensembles BERT models pretrained on different types of clinical data and achieves a Strict F1 of 0.785 on the official test set.

Abstract: Abstract Natural language understanding (NLU) has made massive progress driven by large benchmarks, but benchmarks often leave a long tail of infrequent phenomena underrepresented. We reflect on the question: Have transfer learning methods sufficiently addressed the poor performance of benchmark-trained models on the long tail? We conceptualize the long tail using macro-level dimensions (underrepresented genres, topics, etc.), and perform a qualitative meta-analysis of 100 representative papers on transfer learning research for NLU. Our analysis asks three questions: (i) Which long tail dimensions do transfer learning studies target? (ii) Which properties of adaptation methods help improve performance on the long tail? (iii) Which methodological gaps have greatest negative impact on long tail performance? Our answers highlight major avenues for future research in transfer learning for the long tail. Lastly, using our meta-analysis framework, we perform a case study comparing the performance of various adaptation methods on clinical narratives, which provides interesting insights that may enable us to make progress along these future avenues.
- Xu Wang, C. Rosé, K. Koedinger. 2021. Seeing Beyond Expert Blind Spots: Online Learning Design for Scale and Quality. Abstract: Maximizing system scalability and quality are sometimes at odds. This work provides an example showing scalability and quality can be achieved at the same time in instructional design, contrary to what instructors may believe or expect. We situate our study in the education of HCI methods, and provide suggestions to improve active learning within the HCI education community. While designing learning and assessment activities, many instructors face the choice of using open-ended or close-ended activities. Close-ended activities such as multiple-choice questions (MCQs) enable automated feedback to students. However, a survey with 22 HCI professors revealed a belief that MCQs are less valuable than open-ended questions, and thus, using them entails making a quality sacrifice in order to achieve scalability. A study with 178 students produced no evidence to support the teacher belief. This paper indicates more promise than concern in using MCQs for scalable instruction and assessment in at least some HCI domains.

Combining Collaborative Reflection based on Worked-Out Examples with Problem-Solving Practice: Designing Collaborative Programming Projects for Learning at Scale. Abstract: Computer science pedagogy has overwhelmingly favored problem-solving practice over methods of engagement like worked-out example study especially in advanced classes. This is due to the belief that while these alternative methods may improve student conceptual learning, they may leave them less able to perform on authentic problem-solving tasks from a lack of hands-on practice. In this paper, we perform a direct comparison of this trade-off in a synchronous collaborative programming project by adjusting the boundary between problem-solving and collaborative reflection based on a worked-out example while keeping the total time on task constant. We find that the more time students spent on worked example study, the more was the observed improvement in the pre- to post-test scores with no significant difference in performance on a subsequent problem-solving task. These results, therefore, challenge the dominant place of problem-solving practice in the advanced curricular context and inform the design of collaborative programming projects at scale.
- Xiaopeng Lu, Zhenhua Fan, Yansen Wang, Jean Oh, C. Rosé. 2021. Localize, Group, and Select: Boosting Text-VQA by Scene Text Modeling. Abstract: As an important task in multimodal context understanding, Text-VQA (Visual Question Answering) aims at question answering through reading text information in images. It differentiates from the original VQA task as Text-VQA requires large amounts of scene-text relationship understanding, in addition to the cross-modal grounding capability. In this paper, we propose Localize, Group, and Select (LOGOS), a novel model which attempts to tackle this problem from multiple aspects. LOGOS leverages two grounding tasks to better localize the key information of the image, utilizes scene text clustering to group individual OCR tokens, and learns to select the best answer from different sources of OCR (Optical Character Recognition) texts. Experiments show that LOGOS outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods on two Text-VQA benchmarks without using additional OCR annotation data. Ablation studies and analysis demonstrate the capability of LOGOS to bridge different modalities and better understand scene text.

Abstract: Recent work on entity coreference resolution (CR) follows current trends in Deep Learning applied to embeddings and relatively simple task-related features. SOTA models do not make use of hierarchical representations of discourse structure. In this work, we leverage automatically constructed discourse parse trees within a neural approach and demonstrate a significant improvement on two benchmark entity coreference-resolution datasets. We explore how the impact varies depending upon the type of mention.
- Qinlan Shen, C. Rosé. 2021. What Sounds “Right” to Me? Experiential Factors in the Perception of Political Ideology. Abstract: In this paper, we challenge the assumption that political ideology is inherently built into text by presenting an investigation into the impact of experiential factors on annotator perceptions of political ideology. We construct an annotated corpus of U.S. political discussion, where in addition to ideology labels for texts, annotators provide information about their political affiliation, exposure to political news, and familiarity with the source domain of discussion, Reddit. We investigate the variability in ideology judgments across annotators, finding evidence that these experiential factors may influence the consistency of how political ideologies are perceived. Finally, we present evidence that understanding how humans perceive and interpret ideology from texts remains a challenging task for state-of-the-art language models, pointing towards potential issues when modeling user experiences that may require more contextual knowledge.

Abstract: Fanfiction presents an opportunity as a data source for research in NLP, education, and social science. However, answering specific research questions with this data is difficult, since fanfiction contains more diverse writing styles than formal fiction. We present a text processing pipeline for fanfiction, with a focus on identifying text associated with characters. The pipeline includes modules for character identification and coreference, as well as the attribution of quotes and narration to those characters. Additionally, the pipeline contains a novel approach to character coreference that uses knowledge from quote attribution to resolve pronouns within quotes. For each module, we evaluate the effectiveness of various approaches on 10 annotated fanfiction stories. This pipeline outperforms tools developed for formal fiction on the tasks of character coreference and quote attribution
- K. Koedinger, C. Rosé. 2021. Practice-Based Teacher Questioning Strategy Training with ELK. Abstract: Practice is essential for learning. However, for many interpersonal skills, there often are not enough opportunities and venues for novices to repeatedly practice. Role-playing simulations offer a promising framework to advance practice-based professional training for complex communication skills, in fields such as teaching. In this work, we introduce ELK (Eliciting Learner Knowledge), a role-playing simulation system that helps K-12 teachers develop effective questioning strategies to elicit learners' prior knowledge. We evaluate ELK with 75 pre-service teachers through a mixed-method study. We find that teachers demonstrate a modest increase in effective questioning strategies and develop sympathy towards students after using ELK for 3 rounds. We implement a supplementary activity in ELK in which users evaluate transcripts generated from past role-play sessions. We have tentative evidence that a combination of role-play and evaluating conversation moves may be more effective for learning. We contribute design implications of using role-play systems for communication strategy training.

Teacher Moments: A digital clinical simulation platform with extensible AI architecture. Abstract: Teacher Moments is an open source platform that allows the authoring of simulations used for education which we recently revised to integrate intelligent coaching agents. The initial simulation development for Teacher Moments focused on teacher education, but the platform is actively used for professional development with nurses, psychologists, police officers, judges, and attorneys. Simulations can range in complexity from single-user simulations to multi-user role-play simulations. Single-user simulations provide opportunities for participants to respond using text or audio inputs while multiuser simulations extend those response types to include chat functionality. To support participant learning, Teacher Moments simulations can now be configured to include intelligent coaching agents that review participant inputs, identify salient patterns in text or speech, and respond with feedback and coaching supports. Teacher Moments can be configured to incorporate text or audio binary classifiers or include conversational agents into the chat feature. Once a classifier is configured there is functionality to dynamically display content based on audio or text classification when authoring the simulation. In addition, conversational agents can interject comments into the chat directed at either a particular participant or to all participants in a chat. Finally, there is a new integrated labeling component that supports collecting binary labels from participants for text or audio data, which can be used either to validate the accuracy of a classifier or to establish training data for a classifier. In this demo, we will: 1) highlight GitHub repositories designed to support the deployment of classifiers that can be integrated into Teacher Moments; 2) demonstrate a conversational agent integrated into the chat feature to provide intelligent supports; 3) illustrate how binary classification can trigger the dynamic display of content providing options for dynamic learning supports; and 4) demonstrate how the labeling component can be used for either validation of a classifier or collection of training data.

Abstract: On-line discussions are composed of multiple inter-woven threads, regardless of whether that threaded structure is made explicit in the representation and presentation of the conversational data. Recovering the thread structure is valuable since it makes it possible to isolate discussion related to specific subtopics or related to particular conversational goals. In prior work, thread structure has been reconstructed using explicit meta-data features such as posted by and reply to relationships. The contribution of this paper is a novel approach to recovering thread structure in discussion forums where this explicit meta-data is missing. This approach uses a graph-based representation of a collection of messages where connections between messages are postulated based on inter-message similarity. We evaluate three variations of this simple baseline approach that exploit in different ways the temporal relationships between messages. The results show that the three proposed approaches outperform the simple threshold-cut baseline.

Abstract: In this paper, we provide an overview of the CODI-CRAC 2021 Shared-Task: Anaphora Resolution in Dialogue. The shared task focuses on detecting anaphoric relations in different genres of conversations. Using five conversational datasets, four of which have been newly annotated with a wide range of anaphoric relations: identity, bridging references and discourse deixis, we defined multiple subtasks focusing individually on these key relations. We discuss the evaluation scripts used to assess the system performance on these subtasks, and provide a brief summary of the participating systems and the results obtained across ?? runs from 5 teams, with most submissions achieving significantly better results than our baseline methods.

The effects of a learning analytics dashboard on teachers’ diagnosis and intervention in computer-supported collaborative learning. Abstract: ABSTRACT The learning analytics dashboard (LAD) has been recognised as a useful tool to facilitate teachers’ diagnosis and intervention in collaborative learning. However, little empirical evidence has been reported concerning the effects of LAD on teachers in computer-supported collaborative learning (CSCL). The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of a LAD system called the Knowledge-Behavior-Social Dashboard (KBSD) for supporting teachers’ diagnosis and intervention of CSCL activities. Thirty-five pre-service teachers participated in the experiment. The results indicated that teachers using KBSD used more ‘cross-group’ strategies to diagnose students’ learning problems. Teachers in the experimental group also performed more interventions involving ‘cognitive guidance’, ‘scaffold instructing’, ‘positive evaluation’ and ‘individual facilitating’. Moreover, the analysis of the interview revealed that the KBSD tool has the potential to assist teachers in detecting learning problems in a group in an easy and convenient manner. Pedagogical implications and future research are also addressed.
- Sopan Khosla, C. Rosé. 2020. Using Type Information to Improve Entity Coreference Resolution. Abstract: Coreference resolution (CR) is an essential part of discourse analysis. Most recently, neural approaches have been proposed to improve over SOTA models from earlier paradigms. So far none of the published neural models leverage external semantic knowledge such as type information. This paper offers the first such model and evaluation, demonstrating modest gains in accuracy by introducing either gold standard or predicted types. In the proposed approach, type information serves both to (1) improve mention representation and (2) create a soft type consistency check between coreference candidate mentions. Our evaluation covers two different grain sizes of types over four different benchmark corpora.

Abstract: Open-domain Keyphrase extraction (KPE) on the Web is a fundamental yet complex NLP task with a wide range of practical applications within the field of Information Retrieval. In contrast to other document types, web page designs are intended for easy navigation and information finding. Effective designs encode within the layout and formatting signals that point to where the important information can be found. In this work, we propose a modeling approach that leverages these multi-modal signals to aid in the KPE task. In particular, we leverage both lexical and visual features (e.g., size, font, position) at the micro-level to enable effective strategy induction and meta-level features that describe pages at a macro-level to aid in strategy selection. Our evaluation demonstrates that a combination of effective strategy induction and strategy selection within this approach for the KPE task outperforms state-of-the-art models. A qualitative post-hoc analysis illustrates how these features function within the model.
- Sopan Khosla, Shikhar Vashishth, J. Lehman, C. Rosé. 2020. Improving Detection and Categorization of Task-relevant Utterances through Integration of Discourse Structure and Ontological Knowledge. Abstract: Information extraction from conversational data is particularly challenging because the task-centric nature of conversation allows for effective communication of implicit information by humans, but is challenging for machines. The challenges may differ between utterances depending on the role of the speaker within the conversation, especially when relevant expertise is distributed asymmetrically across roles. Further, the challenges may also increase over the conversation as more shared context is built up through information communicated implicitly earlier in the dialogue. In this paper, we propose the novel modeling approach MedFilter, which addresses these insights in order to increase performance at identifying and categorizing task-relevant utterances, and in so doing, positively impacts performance at a downstream information extraction task. We evaluate this approach on a corpus of nearly 7,000 doctor-patient conversations where MedFilter is used to identify medically relevant contributions to the discussion (achieving a 10% improvement over SOTA baselines in terms of area under the PR curve). Identifying task-relevant utterances benefits downstream medical processing, achieving improvements of 15%, 105%, and 23% respectively for the extraction of symptoms, medications, and complaints.

Abstract: Conversational user interfaces open up new opportunities for reflection guidance. This paper presents a computer-mediated dialogue structure for reflecting on learning tasks, Rebo Junior, and its evaluation in the context of apprenticeship training. We answer three research questions. Firstly, how apprentices react to Rebo Junior; secondly, whether Rebo Junior’s dialogue structure is apt to lead apprentices in reflective conversations; and thirdly, how user engagement with Rebo Junior develops over time. During three months, 17 apprentices led 153 reflective conversations with Rebo Junior in the context of a training workshop, 117 in phase one and 36 in phase two of the study (five to thirteen interactions per apprentice). We coded interactions manually for coherence, level of reflectivity, and user engagement. Our results show that apprentices react well to the intervention and that the dialogue structure is successful in leading apprentices through different levels of reflection (114 out of 153 showed observable reflection on the learning experience; 133 out of 153 expressed learning or planned behaviour change for future tasks). Furthermore, the interactions between the apprentices and Rebo Junior result in coherent conversations (149 out of 153 were coherent). Contrary to expectations, engagement did not decrease over time in either phase. With the present paper, we therefore publish a dialogue structure for reflecting on learning tasks that has worked extremely well despite no adaptivity in the conversational interface. Overall, we interpret the results of our work as underscoring the importance of dialogue structure quality in conversational agents.

Abstract: The notion of face refers to the public self-image of an individual that emerges both from the individual's own actions as well as from the interaction with others. Modeling face and understanding its state changes throughout a conversation is critical to the study of maintenance of basic human needs in and through interaction. Grounded in the politeness theory of Brown and Levinson (1978), we propose a generalized framework for modeling face acts in persuasion conversations, resulting in a reliable coding manual, an annotated corpus, and computational models. The framework reveals insights about differences in face act utilization between asymmetric roles in persuasion conversations. Using computational models, we are able to successfully identify face acts as well as predict a key conversational outcome (e.g. donation success). Finally, we model a latent representation of the conversational state to analyze the impact of predicted face acts on the probability of a positive conversational outcome and observe several correlations that corroborate previous findings.

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI) plays an increasingly important role in improving HCI and user experience. Yet many challenges persist in designing and innovating valuable human-AI interactions. For example, AI systems can make unpredictable errors, and these errors damage UX and even lead to undesired societal impact. However, HCI routinely grapples with complex technologies and mitigates their unintended consequences. What makes AI different? What makes human-AI interaction appear particularly difficult to design? This paper investigates these questions. We synthesize prior research, our own design and research experience, and our observations when teaching human-AI interaction. We identify two sources of AI's distinctive design challenges: 1) uncertainty surrounding AI's capabilities, 2) AI's output complexity, spanning from simple to adaptive complex. We identify four levels of AI systems. On each level, designers encounter a different subset of the design challenges. We demonstrate how these findings reveal new insights for designers, researchers, and design tool makers in productively addressing the challenges of human-AI interaction going forward.

Abstract: Compared to other helping professions, teacher training typically lacks sufficient opportunities for novices to practice new skills. When teachers learn, they listen to people talk about teaching, or talk about teaching themselves, but they very rarely do the work of teaching. Games and simulations offer a promising framework to advance practice-based professional training for complex skills such as teaching. In this work, we built a role-playing simulation ELK to help teachers develop effective questioning strategies to elicit learner prior knowledge. We evaluate ELK with 76 pre-service teachers in two modes, one is more akin to the kind of human-human interaction that is germane to teaching but requires more human resources and one that can be done independently. We find that in both cases ELK raises awareness about student misconceptions and the importance of student thinking, and teachers demonstrate a modest increase in effective questioning strategies after three rounds of playing.

Designing for learning during collaborative projects online: tools and takeaways. Abstract: Purpose: In response to the evolving COVID-19 pandemic, many universities have transitioned to online instruction. With learning promising to be online, at least in part, for the near future, instructors may be thinking of providing online collaborative learning opportunities to their students who are increasingly isolated from their peers because of social distancing guidelines. This paper aims to provide design recommendations for online collaborative project-based learning exercises based on this research in a software engineering course at the university level. Design/methodology/approach: Through joint work between learning scientists, course instructors and software engineering practitioners, instructional design best practices of alignment between the context of the learners, the learning objectives, the task and the assessment are actualized in the design of collaborative programming projects for supporting learning. The design, first segments a short real-time collaborative exercise into tasks, each with a problem-solving phase where students participate in collaborative programming, and a reflection phase for reflecting on what they learned in the task. Within these phases, a role-assignment paradigm scaffolds collaboration by assigning groups of four students to four complementary roles that rotate after each task. Findings: By aligning each task with granular learning objectives, significant pre- to post-test learning from the exercise as well as each task is observed. Originality/value: The roles used in the paradigm discourage divide-and-conquer tendencies often associated with collaborative projects. By requiring students to discuss conflicting ideas to arrive at a consensus implementation, their ideas are made explicit, thus providing opportunities for clarifying misconceptions through discussion and learning from the collaboration.

- Samridhi Choudhary, C. Bogart, C. Rosé, J. Herbsleb. 2020. Using Productive Collaboration Bursts to Analyze Open Source Collaboration Effectiveness. Abstract: Developers of open-source software projects tend to collaborate in bursts of activity over a few days at a time, rather than at an even pace. A project might find its productivity suffering if bursts of activity occur when a key person with the right role or right expertise is not available to participate. Open-source projects could benefit from monitoring the way they orchestrate attention among key developers, finding ways to make themselves available to one another when needed. In commercial software development, Sociotechnical Congruence (STC) has been used as a measure to assess whether coordination among developers is sufficient for a given task. However, STC has not previously been successfully applied to open-source projects, in which some industrial assumptions do not apply: management-chosen targets, mandated steady work hours, and top-down task allocation of inputs and targets. In this work we propose an operationalization of STC for open-source software development. We use temporal bursts of activity as a unit of analysis more suited to the natural rhythms of open-source work, as well as open source analogues of other component measures needed for calculating STC. As an illustration, we demonstrate that open-source development on PyPI projects in GitHub is indeed bursty, that activities in the bursts have topical coherence, and we apply our operationalization of STC. We argue that a measure of socio-technical congruence adapted to open source could provide projects with a better way of tracking how effectively they are collaborating when they come together to collaborate.

Abstract: Research on content propagation in social media has largely focused on features from the content of posts and the network structure of users. However, social media platforms are also spaces where users present their identities in particular ways. How do the ways users present themselves affect how content they produce is propagated? In this paper, we address this question with an empirical study of interaction and self-presentation data from Tumblr. We use a pairwise learning-to-rank framework to predict whether a given user will reblog (share) another user’s post from features comparing self-presented textual and visual identity information. We find evidence that alignment in identity presentation is associated with content propagation, as these features increase performance over a baseline of content features. Interpreting learned feature weights on self-presented text identity labels, we find that users who present labels that match or indicate shared interests and values are generally more likely to propagate each other’s content.

Abstract: Medical entity linking is the task of identifying and standardizing medical concepts referred to in an unstructured text. Most of the existing methods adopt a three-step approach of (1) detecting mentions, (2) generating a list of candidate concepts, and finally (3) picking the best concept among them. In this paper, we probe into alleviating the problem of overgeneration of candidate concepts in the candidate generation module, the most under-studied component of medical entity linking. For this, we present MedType, a fully modular system that prunes out irrelevant candidate concepts based on the predicted semantic type of an entity mention. We incorporate MedType into five off-the-shelf toolkits for medical entity linking and demonstrate that it consistently improves entity linking performance across several benchmark datasets. To address the dearth of annotated training data for medical entity linking, we present WikiMed and PubMedDS, two large-scale medical entity linking datasets, and demonstrate that pre-training MedType on these datasets further improves entity linking performance. We make our source code and datasets publicly available for medical entity linking research.
- Aakanksha Naik, J. Lehman, C. Rosé. 2020. Adapting Event Extractors to Medical Data: Bridging the Covariate Shift. Abstract: We tackle the task of adapting event extractors to new domains without labeled data, by aligning the marginal distributions of source and target domains. As a testbed, we create two new event extraction datasets using English texts from two medical domains: (i) clinical notes, and (ii) doctor-patient conversations. We test the efficacy of three marginal alignment techniques: (i) adversarial domain adaptation (ADA), (ii) domain adaptive fine-tuning (DAFT), and (iii) a new instance weighting technique based on language model likelihood scores (LIW). LIW and DAFT improve over a no-transfer BERT baseline on both domains, but ADA only improves on notes. Deeper analysis of performance under different types of shifts (e.g., lexical shift, semantic shift) explains some of the variations among models. Our best-performing models reach F1 scores of 70.0 and 72.9 on notes and conversations respectively, using no labeled target data.

Normalizing mentions of medical concepts to standardized vocabularies is a fundamental component of clinical text analysis. Ambiguity-words or phrases that may refer to different concepts-has been extensively researched as part of information extraction from biomedical literature, but less is known about the types and frequency of ambiguity in clinical text. This study characterizes the distribution and distinct types of ambiguity exhibited by benchmark clinical concept normalization datasets, in order to identify directions for advancing medical concept normalization research.


MATERIALS AND METHODS
We identified ambiguous strings in datasets derived from the 2 available clinical corpora for concept normalization and categorized the distinct types of ambiguity they exhibited. We then compared observed string ambiguity in the datasets with potential ambiguity in the Unified Medical Language System (UMLS) to assess how representative available datasets are of ambiguity in clinical language.


RESULTS
We found that <15% of strings were ambiguous within the datasets, while over 50% were ambiguous in the UMLS, indicating only partial coverage of clinical ambiguity. The percentage of strings in common between any pair of datasets ranged from 2% to only 36%; of these, 40% were annotated with different sets of concepts, severely limiting generalization. Finally, we observed 12 distinct types of ambiguity, distributed unequally across the available datasets, reflecting diverse linguistic and medical phenomena.


DISCUSSION
Existing datasets are not sufficient to cover the diversity of clinical concept ambiguity, limiting both training and evaluation of normalization methods for clinical text. Additionally, the UMLS offers important semantic information for building and evaluating normalization methods.


CONCLUSIONS
Our findings identify 3 opportunities for concept normalization research, including a need for ambiguity-specific clinical datasets and leveraging the rich semantics of the UMLS in new methods and evaluation measures for normalization.

Abstract: Analysis of student writing, both for assessment and for enabling feedback have been of interest to the field of learning analytics. While much progress can be made through detection of local cues in writing, structured prediction approaches offer capabilities that are particularly well tailored to the needs of models aiming to offer substantive feedback on rhetorical structure. We thus cast the analysis of rhetorical structure in academic writing as a structured prediction task in which we employ models that leverage both local and global cues in writing. In particular, this paper presents a hierarchical neural architecture that performs this task. The evaluation demonstrates that the architecture achieves near-human performance while significantly surpassing state-of-the-art baselines. A multifaceted approach to model interpretation offers insights into the inner workings of the model.
- R. Iyer, C. Rosé. 2019. A Machine Learning Framework for Authorship Identification From Texts. Abstract: Authorship identification is a process in which the author of a text is identified. Most known literary texts can easily be attributed to a certain author because they are, for example, signed. Yet sometimes we find unfinished pieces of work or a whole bunch of manuscripts with a wide variety of possible authors. In order to assess the importance of such a manuscript, it is vital to know who wrote it. In this work, we aim to develop a machine learning framework to effectively determine authorship. We formulate the task as a single-label multi-class text categorization problem and propose a supervised machine learning framework incorporating stylometric features. This task is highly interdisciplinary in that it takes advantage of machine learning, information retrieval, and natural language processing. We present an approach and a model which learns the differences in writing style between $50$ different authors and is able to predict the author of a new text with high accuracy. The accuracy is seen to increase significantly after introducing certain linguistic stylometric features along with text features.

Abstract: We propose a novel take on understanding narratives in social media, focusing on learning ”functional story schemas”, which consist of sets of stereotypical functional structures. We develop an unsupervised pipeline to extract schemas and apply our method to Reddit posts to detect schematic structures that are characteristic of different subreddits. We validate our schemas through human interpretation and evaluate their utility via a text classification task. Our experiments show that extracted schemas capture distinctive structural patterns in different subreddits, improving classification performance of several models by 2.4% on average. We also observe that these schemas serve as lenses that reveal community norms.

Abstract: We introduce a general method for the interpretation and comparison of neural models. The method is used to factor a complex neural model into its functional components, which are comprised of sets of co-firing neurons that cut across layers of the network architecture, and which we call neural pathways. The function of these pathways can be understood by identifying correlated task level and linguistic heuristics in such a way that this knowledge acts as a lens for approximating what the network has learned to apply to its intended task. As a case study for investigating the utility of these pathways, we present an examination of pathways identified in models trained for two standard tasks, namely Named Entity Recognition and Recognizing Textual Entailment.

Abstract: Product reviews offer a spectrum of snap-shot perspectives on product experiences. In contrast, product oriented discussion forums, such as found on Reddit, offer the possibility to examine reactions to products in the context of a user’s posting history. Examination of typical product usage trajectories affords extraction of more nuanced understandings of user experiences that connect opinions on products with features of users or situations in which products are used. This paper presents a computational modeling approach to construction of user profiles that enable construction of structured representations of user experiences with products over time. Using this approach it is possible to identify types of experience trajectories and how they are differentially associated with characteristics of users.

Abstract: Quantitative reasoning is a higher-order reasoning skill that any intelligent natural language understanding system can reasonably be expected to handle. We present EQUATE (Evaluating Quantitative Understanding Aptitude in Textual Entailment), a new framework for quantitative reasoning in textual entailment. We benchmark the performance of 9 published NLI models on EQUATE, and find that on average, state-of-the-art methods do not achieve an absolute improvement over a majority-class baseline, suggesting that they do not implicitly learn to reason with quantities. We establish a new baseline Q-REAS that manipulates quantities symbolically. In comparison to the best performing NLI model, it achieves success on numerical reasoning tests (+24.2 %), but has limited verbal reasoning capabilities (-8.1 %). We hope our evaluation framework will support the development of models of quantitative reasoning in language understanding.
- Qinlan Shen, C. Rosé. 2019. The Discourse of Online Content Moderation: Investigating Polarized User Responses to Changes in Reddit’s Quarantine Policy. Abstract: Recent concerns over abusive behavior on their platforms have pressured social media companies to strengthen their content moderation policies. However, user opinions on these policies have been relatively understudied. In this paper, we present an analysis of user responses to a September 27, 2018 announcement about the quarantine policy on Reddit as a case study of to what extent the discourse on content moderation is polarized by users’ ideological viewpoint. We introduce a novel partitioning approach for characterizing user polarization based on their distribution of participation across interest subreddits. We then use automated techniques for capturing framing to examine how users with different viewpoints discuss moderation issues, finding that right-leaning users invoked censorship while left-leaning users highlighted inconsistencies on how content policies are applied. Overall, we argue for a more nuanced approach to moderation by highlighting the intersection of behavior and ideology in considering how abusive language is defined and regulated.
- Aakanksha Naik, Luke Breitfeller, C. Rosé. 2019. TDDiscourse: A Dataset for Discourse-Level Temporal Ordering of Events. Abstract: Prior work on temporal relation classification has focused extensively on event pairs in the same or adjacent sentences (local), paying scant attention to discourse-level (global) pairs. This restricts the ability of systems to learn temporal links between global pairs, since reliance on local syntactic features suffices to achieve reasonable performance on existing datasets. However, systems should be capable of incorporating cues from document-level structure to assign temporal relations. In this work, we take a first step towards discourse-level temporal ordering by creating TDDiscourse, the first dataset focusing specifically on temporal links between event pairs which are more than one sentence apart. We create TDDiscourse by augmenting TimeBank-Dense, a corpus of English news articles, manually annotating global pairs that cannot be inferred automatically from existing annotations. Our annotations double the number of temporal links in TimeBank-Dense, while possessing several desirable properties such as focusing on long-distance pairs and not being automatically inferable. We adapt and benchmark the performance of three state-of-the-art models on TDDiscourse and observe that existing systems indeed find discourse-level temporal ordering harder.

Abstract: Many interactional archetypes from outside of learning contexts are being adapted and widely used for online learning environments without consideration for some of the side effects relevant to learner outcomes. Of particular concern is the effectiveness of help exchange in these learning environments. To address this need, this article explores how the reputation system features of up/downvoting, badges, and displayed expertise impact student helper selection in a peer help exchange system within a MOOC discussion forum. We draw from Expectancy Value Theory for Help Sources as a theoretical framework for positioning the work. Results from our field experiment show that up/downvoting has a negative impact on help seeking which is mitigated by the positive effect of Help Giver badges. The mechanism behind these results are then explored in a survey experiment investigating reputation systems’ impact on students’ expectancies, values, and costs for a help source.

Factors Affecting Health Care Engagement of Patients With End-Stage Heart Failure: An Exploratory Survey Study. Abstract: Background. The decision to receive a permanent left ventricular assist device (LVAD) to treat end-stage heart failure (HF) involves understanding and weighing the risks and benefits of a highly invasive treatment. The goal of this study was to characterize end-stage HF patients across parameters that may affect their decision making and to inform the development of an LVAD decision support tool. Methods. A survey of 35 end-stage HF patients at an LVAD implant hospital was performed to characterize their information-seeking habits, interaction with physicians, technology use, numeracy, and concerns about their health. Survey responses were analyzed using descriptive statistics, grounded theory method, and Bayesian network learning. Results. Most patients indicated an interest in using some type of decision support tool (roadmap of health progression: 46%, n = 16; personal prognosis: 51%, n = 18; short videos of patients telling stories of their experiences with an LVAD: 57%, n = 20). Information patients desired in a hypothetical decision support tool fell into the following topics: prognoses for health outcomes, technical information seeking, expressing emotions, and treatment decisions. Desire for understanding their condition was closely related to whether they had difficult interpreting their electronic medical record in the past. Conclusions. Most patients reported interest in engaging in their health care decision making and seeing their prognosis and electronic health record information. Patients who were less interested in their own treatment decisions were characterized by having less success understanding their health information. Design of a decision support tool for potential LVAD patients should consider a spectrum of health literacy and include information beyond the technical specifications of LVAD support.

Abstract: In schools and colleges around the world, open-ended home-work assignments are commonly used. However, such assignments require substantial instructor effort for grading, and tend not to support opportunities for repeated practice. We propose UpGrade, a novel learnersourcing approach that generates scalable learning opportunities using prior student solutions to open-ended problems. UpGrade creates interactive questions that offer automated and real-time feedback, while enabling repeated practice. In a two-week experiment in a college-level HCI course, students answering UpGrade-created questions instead of traditional open-ended assignments achieved indistinguishable learning outcomes in ~30% less time. Further, no manual grading effort is required. To enhance quality control, UpGrade incorporates a psychometric approach using crowd workers' answers to automatically prune out low quality questions, resulting in a question bank that exceeds reliability standards for classroom use.

Furthermore, we highlight the great potential of using RST to provide automated feedback for improving writing quality across genres.

Online Mob Programming: Bridging the 21st Century Workplace and the Classroom. Abstract: : We investigate how an industry-standard collaborative software development paradigm can be adapted for collaborative project-based learning in the classroom. The synchronous face-to-face collaboration paradigm, called Mob Programming, inspires Online Mob Programming (OMP), which structures groups of 3-6 students collaborating online in a rotating set of 3 roles supported by a conversational computer agent who takes on a 4 th role. Results comparing OMP scaffolding with self-organization in a university computer science course shows OMP scaffolds encourage role-taking, division of labor, and conceptual reflection during work without a significant drop in group product quality.

Group Formation in the Digital Age: Relevant Characteristics, Their Diagnosis, and Combination for Productive Collaboration. Abstract: This symposium tackles a central topic in CSCL, group formation for productive collaborative learning with / in digital media. Traditional research on group formation has investigated mostly separate learner characteristics as preconditions of learning. Combinations of different learner characteristics and of learner characteristics with collaborative processes have been less in focus. Considering such combinations is necessary to represent the complexity of group interactions and learning. Despite the digitalization of learning, there has been only few attempts to investigate the diagnostic information that mining learner texts and learning processes can contribute to addressing this complexity for optimal group formation, and to assign groups automatically based on multiple parameters simultaneously. This symposium brings together a multi-disciplinary and international consortium of researchers who all focus on group formation for computer supported collaborative learning. They complement each other in investigating different combinations of learner characteristics, learning processes and automatic techniques for optimal group formation.

Abstract: Word embeddings are now pervasive across NLP subfields as the de-facto method of forming text representataions. In this work, we show that existing embedding models are inadequate at constructing representations that capture salient aspects of mathematical meaning for numbers, which is important for language understanding. Numbers are ubiquitous and frequently appear in text. Inspired by cognitive studies on how humans perceive numbers, we develop an analysis framework to test how well word embeddings capture two essential properties of numbers: magnitude (e.g. 3<4) and numeration (e.g. 3=three). Our experiments reveal that most models capture an approximate notion of magnitude, but are inadequate at capturing numeration. We hope that our observations provide a starting point for the development of methods which better capture numeracy in NLP systems.
- C. Rosé, Elizabeth Mclaughlin, Ran Liu, K. Koedinger. 2019. Explanatory learner models: Why machine learning (alone) is not the answer. Abstract: Using data to understand learning and improve education has great promise. However, the promise will not be achieved simply by AI and Machine Learning researchers developing innovative models that more accurately predict labeled data. As AI advances, modeling techniques and the models they produce are getting increasingly complex, often involving tens of thousands of parameters or more. Though strides towards interpretation of complex models are being made in core machine learning communities, it remains true in these cases of "black box" modeling that research teams may have little possibility to peer inside to try understand how, why, or even whether such models will work when applied beyond the data on which they were built. Rather than relying on AI expertise alone, we suggest that learning engineering teams bring interdisciplinary expertise to bear to develop explanatory learner models that provide interpretable and actionable insights in addition to accurate prediction. We describe examples that illustrate use of different kinds of data (eg, click stream and discourse data) in different course content (eg, math and writing) and toward different goals (eg, improving student models and generating actionable feedback). We recommend learning engineering teams, shared infrastructure and funder incentives toward better explanatory learner model development that advances learning science, produces better pedagogical practices and demonstrably improves student learning. Practitioner NotesWhat is already known about this topic Researchers in learning analytics and educational data mining have been successful in creating innovative models of data that optimize prediction.Some of these models produce scientific or practical insights and fewer have been put into use and demonstrated to enhance student learning.What this paper adds We provide examples of development of explanatory models of learners that not only accurately predict data but also provide scientific insights and yield practical outcomes.In particular, researchers with expertise in cognitive science and math education content use AI‐based data analytics to discover previously unrecognized barriers to geometry student learning. They use model‐derived insights to redesign an online tutoring system and "close‐the‐loop" by experimentally demonstrating that the new system produces better student learning than the original.Implications for practice and/or policy We define explanatory learning models and provide an articulation of a process for generating them that involves interdisciplinary teams employing human–computer interaction and learning engineering methods.Based on our experiences, we recommend learning engineering teams, shared infrastructure and funder incentives toward better explanatory learner model development that advances learning science, produces better pedagogical practices and demonstrably improves student learning.

Time-series Insights into the Process of Passing or Failing Online University Courses using Neural-Induced Interpretable Student States. Abstract: This paper addresses a key challenge in Educational Data Mining, namely to model student behavioral trajectories in order to provide a means for identifying students most at-risk, with the goal of providing supportive interventions. While many forms of data including clickstream data or data from sensors have been used extensively in time series models for such purposes, in this paper we explore the use of textual data, which is sometimes available in the records of students at large, online universities. We propose a time series model that constructs an evolving student state representation using both clickstream data and a signal extracted from the textual notes recorded by human mentors assigned to each student. We explore how the addition of this textual data improves both the predictive power of student states for the purpose of identifying students at risk for course failure as well as for providing interpretable insights about student course engagement processes.

Abstract: Natural language inference (NLI) is the task of determining if a natural language hypothesis can be inferred from a given premise in a justifiable manner. NLI was proposed as a benchmark task for natural language understanding. Existing models perform well at standard datasets for NLI, achieving impressive results across different genres of text. However, the extent to which these models understand the semantic content of sentences is unclear. In this work, we propose an evaluation methodology consisting of automatically constructed “stress tests” that allow us to examine whether systems have the ability to make real inferential decisions. Our evaluation of six sentence-encoder models on these stress tests reveals strengths and weaknesses of these models with respect to challenging linguistic phenomena, and suggests important directions for future work in this area.

Abstract: Support of discussion based learning at scale benefits from automated analysis of discussion for enabling effective assignment of students to project teams, for triggering dynamic support of group learning processes, and for assessment of those learning processes. A major limitation of much past work in machine learning applied to automated analysis of discussion is the failure of the models to generalize to data outside of the parameters of the context in which the training data was collected. This limitation means that a separate training effort must be undertaken for each domain in which the models will be used. This paper focuses on a specific construct of discussion based learning referred to as Transactivity and provides a novel machine learning approach with performance that exceeds state-of-the-art performance within the same domain in which it was trained and a new domain, and does not suffer any reduction in performance when transferring to the new domain. These results stand as an advance over past work on automated detection of Transactivity and increase the value of trained models for supporting group learning at scale. Implications for practice in at-scale learning environments are discussed.

Crowdsourcing and Education: Towards a Theory and Praxis of Learnersourcing. Abstract: : Due to the scale of online environments, large numbers of learners interact with the exact same resources, such as online math homework problems and videos. It is therefore essential these are of the highest quality to help learners. Ideally, online educational resources would constantly improve based on data and input from each learner, giving a better outcome for the next. This symposium explores issues around the use of crowdsourcing to harness learners’ interactions with resources like online problems and videos in order to improve these resources for the next learner. We hope to explore the benefits and limitations of thinking about learners through the lens of crowdsourcing, to imagine learner sourcing. We will discuss four ways in which researchers have leveraged crowdsourcing to help students learn in a variety of educational contexts, and in doing so we will also discuss ways in which educational theory can guide the future of learnersourcing.

Abstract: In open-source software development, coordination between globally separated developers is often structured in ways not immediately visible to them, such as implicit groupings of people working on similar code and related issues. This opacity is despite the availability and accessibility of a large quantity of low-level project activity data on platforms like GitHub. This paper uses this low-level data to construct meaningful indicators that could offer improved transparency into how coordination is conducted in open source. Prior work has shown the value of Socio-Technical Congruence for evaluating the quality of coordination in commercial software systems. However, little work has successfully translated this analysis to the domain of open source, primarily due to their less formal and inconsistent ways of partitioning work, assigning tasks and measuring success. We present a technique for distinguishing the active phases of coordination and define a measure of productivity for these projects. We perform a quantitative analysis of the influence of congruence on productivity in these phases demonstrating that the associations between our measure of productivity and the measures of congruence and other control variables are subtle but consistent with the prior work in commercial software development and discuss some applications of our work.
- Iris K. Howley, C. Rosé. 2018. Empirical Evidence for Evaluation Anxiety and Expectancy-Value Theory for Help Sources. Abstract: Expectancy-Value Theory for Help Sources (EVT-HS) states that whether or not students seek help from a particular source is determined by their perceived expectation that there will be help available, and the perceived value for the help from that source. This paper provides initial empirical validation for EVT-HS, while also introducing and providing support for costs of seeking help from a particular help source impacting intention to seek help. Our survey experiment shows that raising perceived expectancies and values for a help source significantly predicts a student’s intention to seek help. Our results also show that evaluation anxiety, as a potential negative value, inversely predicts intentions to seek help from a particular source.

Abstract: We present a neural architecture for modeling argumentative dialogue that explicitly models the interplay between an Opinion Holder’s (OH’s) reasoning and a challenger’s argument, with the goal of predicting if the argument successfully changes the OH’s view. The model has two components: (1) vulnerable region detection, an attention model that identifies parts of the OH’s reasoning that are amenable to change, and (2) interaction encoding, which identifies the relationship between the content of the OH’s reasoning and that of the challenger’s argument. Based on evaluation on discussions from the Change My View forum on Reddit, the two components work together to predict an OH’s change in view, outperforming several baselines. A posthoc analysis suggests that sentences picked out by the attention model are addressed more frequently by successful arguments than by unsuccessful ones.

 Moderators are believed to play a crucial role in ensuring the quality of discussion in online political debate forums. The line between moderation and illegitimate censorship, where certain views or individuals are unfairly suppressed, however, is often difficult to define. To better understand the relationship between moderation and censorship, we investigate whether users' perception of moderator bias is supported by how moderators act, using the Big Issues Debate (BID) group on Ravelry as our platform of study. We present our method for measuring bias while taking into account the posting behavior of a user, then apply our method to investigate whether moderators make decisions biased against viewpoints that they may have the incentive to suppress. We find evidence to suggest that while moderators may make decisions biased against individuals with unpopular viewpoints, the effect of this bias is small and often overblown by the users experiencing bias.We argue that the perception of bias by itself is an issue in online political discussions and suggest technological interventions to counteract the discrepancy between perceived and actual censorship in moderation.
 

- Sreecharan Sankaranarayanan, Raghuram Mandyam Annasamy, K. Sycara, C. Rosé. 2018. Combining Model-Free Q-Ensembles and Model-Based Approaches for Informed Exploration. Abstract: Q-Ensembles are a model-free approach where input images are fed into different Q-networks and exploration is driven by the assumption that uncertainty is proportional to the variance of the output Q-values obtained. They have been shown to perform relatively well compared to other exploration strategies. Further, model-based approaches, such as encoder-decoder models have been used successfully for next frame prediction given previous frames. This paper proposes to integrate the model-free Q-ensembles and model-based approaches with the hope of compounding the benefits of both and achieving superior exploration as a result. Results show that a model-based trajectory memory approach when combined with Q-ensembles produces superior performance when compared to only using Q-ensembles.
- C. Rosé. 2017. Expediting the cycle of data to intervention. Abstract: An important research problem in learning analytics is to expedite the cycle of data leading to the analysis of student needs and the improvement of student support. Current work in Learning Analytics and Educational Data Mining provides many examples where machine learning applied to learning relevant data produces models that can teach us about learning processes as well as trigger just-in-time interventions. Though the technology is still young, the time is ripe to look to the future where such learned models will enable personalised experiences to learners at a grand scale. In our own research, we have focused on learning through discussion (Howley & Rosé, in press). In this space, the subfield of Discourse Analytics (Buckingham-Shum, 2013; Buckingham-Shum, De Laat, De Liddo, Ferguson, & Whitelock, 2014; Rosé, in press) provides examples where models with high utility can be learned even over messy, relatively unstructured discourse data. The substantive problems that must be overcome to build effective, interpretable, and actionable models over Discourse data are the continuing focus of work in the area of Discourse Analytics. Beyond this, however, is the more focused, but nevertheless necessary issue of creating a data infrastructure and pipeline specifically targeting this rich but challenging data (Jo, Tomar, Ferschke, Rosé, & Gaesevic, 2016). The foundation of computational analytic work is representation of data. Much of our published work in analytics of collaboration in discussion has been focused on either chat data (Howley, Mayfield, & Rosé, 2013) or transcribed face-to-face discussion (Ai, Sionti, Wang, & Rosé, 2010; Clarke et al., 2013). These can both be represented in a simple, uniform, flat sequence of text segments, each contributed by one speaker. However, when expanding to learning in Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) or learning in other online contexts such as opensource communities, the form that the discussions may take becomes more diverse as they are embedded in a variety of platforms. They may even occur simultaneously through multiple separate streams. To that end we offer a publically available data infrastructure we call DiscourseDB, which enables translation of data from multiple streams into a common, integrated representation. The interface level representation is translated down into Discourses, with embedded Discourse Parts consisting of Contributions, which may be related to one another through Relations, and which are associated with content that can be associated with Annotations. This common representation enables combining data across communication streams and applying common modelling technologies. As a concrete example, consider connectivist Massive Open Online Courses (cMOOCs) that include environments like the competency-based learning platform ProSolo, featured in a recent edX MOOC called Data, Analytics, and Learning (DALMOOC) (Rosé et al., 2015). In these environments data is rich and heterogeneous. In ProSolo, for example, student behaviours formally within the environment include LEARNING: RESEARCH AND PRACTICE, 2017 VOL. 3, NO. 1, 59–62 http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/23735082.2017.1286140

Abstract: Today’s warfighters operate in a highly dynamic and uncertain world, and face many competing demands. Asymmetric warfare and the new focus on small, agile forces has altered the framework by which time critical information is digested and acted upon by decision makers. Finding and integrating decision-relevant information is increasingly difficult in data-dense environments. In this new information environment, agile data algorithms, machine learning software, and threat alert mechanisms must be developed to automatically create alerts and drive quick response. Yet these advanced technologies must be balanced with awareness of the underlying context to accurately interpret machine-processed indicators and warnings and recommendations. One promising approach to this challenge brings together information retrieval strategies from text, video, and imagery. In this paper, we describe a technology demonstration that represents two years of tri-service research seeking to meld text and video for enhanced content awareness. The demonstration used multisource data to find an intelligence solution to a problem using a common dataset. Three technology highlights from this effort include 1) Incorporation of external sources of context into imagery normalcy modeling and anomaly detection capabilities, 2) Automated discovery and monitoring of targeted users from social media text, regardless of language, and 3) The concurrent use of text and imagery to characterize behaviour using the concept of kinematic and text motifs to detect novel and anomalous patterns. Our demonstration provided a technology baseline for exploiting heterogeneous data sources to deliver timely and accurate synopses of data that contribute to a dynamic and comprehensive worldview.

Abstract: In this paper, we describe a system for automatic construction of user disease progression timelines from their posts in online support groups using minimal supervision. In recent years, several online support groups have been established which has led to a huge increase in the amount of patient-authored text available. Creating systems which can automatically extract important medical events and create disease progression timelines for users from such text can help in patient health monitoring as well as studying links between medical events and users’ participation in support groups. Prior work in this domain has used manually constructed keyword sets to detect medical events. In this work, our aim is to perform medical event detection using minimal supervision in order to develop a more general timeline construction system. Our system achieves an accuracy of 55.17%, which is 92% of the performance achieved by a supervised baseline system.

Abstract: In this work we investigate how role-based behavior profiles of a Wikipedia editor, considered against the backdrop of roles taken up by other editors in discussions, predict the success of the editor at achieving an impact on the associated article. We first contribute a new public dataset including a task predicting the success of Wikipedia editors involved in discussion, measured by an operationalization of the lasting impact of their edits in the article. We then propose a probabilistic graphical model that advances earlier work inducing latent discussion roles using the light supervision of success in the negotiation task. We evaluate the performance of the model and interpret findings of roles and group configurations that lead to certain outcomes on Wikipedia.
- Xu Wang, Miaomiao Wen, C. Rosé. 2017. Contrasting Explicit and Implicit Scaffolding for Transactive Exchange in Team Oriented Project Based Learning. Abstract: Script based support for collaborative learning may employ either explicit or implicit scaffolding. If the effect of script based support is mainly by means of its effect on collaborative processes, it would be reasonable to expect that if two forms of support manipulate the same process variable, they would provide redundant rather than synergistic effects when offered together. However, explicit forms of scaffolding may provide additional benefits from the reification of the processes that they provide, which could be received as instruction. This paper contributes to research on dynamic support for collaborative learning by proposing a novel form of micro-level prompt designed to elevate the amount of Transactive exchange. In a 2×2 factorial design, we measure the impact of this explicit form of scaffolding and an implicit form of support for Transactive exchange developed in prior work, alone and in combination in terms of impact on two key outcomes, namely collaborative product quality and acquisition of multi-perspective knowledge. In this study, the pair of manipulations provide synergistic support for group product quality, but only the explicit support contributes to acquisition of multi-perspective knowledge.

Abstract: There has been a long standing interest in understanding ‘Social Influence’ both in Social Sciences and in Computational Linguistics. In this paper, we present a novel approach to study and measure interpersonal influence in daily interactions. Motivated by the basic principles of influence, we attempt to identify indicative linguistic features of the posts in an online knitting community. We present the scheme used to operationalize and label the posts as influential or non-influential. Experiments with the identified features show an improvement in the classification accuracy of influence by 3.15%. Our results illustrate the important correlation between the structure of the language and its potential to influence others.
- W. B. Towne, C. Rosé, J. Herbsleb. 2017. Conflict in Comments: Learning but Lowering Perceptions, with Limits. Abstract: Prior work and perception theory suggests that when exposed to discussion related to a particular piece of crowdsourced text content, readers generally perceive that content to be of lower quality than readers who do not see those comments, and that the effect is stronger if the comments display conflict. This paper presents a controlled experiment with over 1000 participants testing to see if this effect carries over to other documents from the same platform, including those with similar content or by the same author. Although we do generally find that perceived quality of the commented-on document is affected, effects do not carry over to the second item and readers are able to judge the second in isolation from the comment on the first. We confirm a prior finding about the negative effects conflict can have on perceived quality but note that readers report learning more from constructive conflict comments.
- Miaomiao Wen, K. Maki, Steven W. Dow, J. Herbsleb, C. Rosé. 2017. Supporting Virtual Team Formation through Community-Wide Deliberation. Abstract: Team-based learning is a structured, small-group learning method that has been associated with many positive outcomes in traditional classroom settings. However, relatively little research has focused on how to form and support teams within online learning platforms, such as Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs). A number of challenges arise for team formation in voluntary online classes: students may drop out and leave their team, and even if they do persist with the course, the team may not work together effectively. In this paper, we introduce a team-formation strategy that incorporates a deliberation process, where participants hold discussions in preparation for the collaboration task. First, we present a crowdsourced experiment that compares teams that are formed before or after a community deliberation process. Results demonstrate that teams engaging in a larger community deliberative process prior to team formation exhibit better team performance--as measured by team collaboration product quality--than pre-discussion teams. In a second crowdsourced experiment, we further explore the benefits of community-wide processes by automatically assigning teams based on participants' transactive interaction during deliberation. The results demonstrate advantages in terms of team performance for teams formed based on observed interactions during the community-level deliberation, compared to randomly formed teams. Finally, in a case study, we demonstrate how we successfully adapted the team formation strategy for use in a small MOOC.
- Yohan Jo, Michael Miller Yoder, Hyeju Jang, C. Rosé. 2017. Modeling Dialogue Acts with Content Word Filtering and Speaker Preferences. Abstract: We present an unsupervised model of dialogue act sequences in conversation. By modeling topical themes as transitioning more slowly than dialogue acts in conversation, our model de-emphasizes content-related words in order to focus on conversational function words that signal dialogue acts. We also incorporate speaker tendencies to use some acts more than others as an additional predictor of dialogue act prevalence beyond temporal dependencies. According to the evaluation presented on two dissimilar corpora, the CNET forum and NPS Chat corpus, the effectiveness of each modeling assumption is found to vary depending on characteristics of the data. De-emphasizing content-related words yields improvement on the CNET corpus, while utilizing speaker tendencies is advantageous on the NPS corpus. The components of our model complement one another to achieve robust performance on both corpora and outperform state-of-the-art baseline models.
- C. Rosé. 2017. Envisioning support of social learning in MOOCs. Abstract: The explosive growth of MOOCs has generated immense interest in online learning in massive courses. However, much of this frenetic activity has emphasized technology and scalability (Reich, 2015), resulting in rudimentary learning experiences (i.e., brief streaming videos followed by quizzes or online discussion forums). This symposium will showcase and discuss four diverse efforts to advance open learning at scale that are directly informed by contemporary theories of learning and educational research methods. This includes research on inquiry-based community learning, computer-mediated discourse analysis, participatory approaches to learning and assessment, and evidence-rich digital-credentials. In each of the four cases, the desire to extend that program of research to learning at scale resulted in significant advances in the more general program of research. In this way the symposium explores efforts to foster learning at scale might advance our theories of learning and our principles and methods for learning design more generally.
- Gaurav Singh Tomar, Sreecharan Sankaranarayanan, Xu Wang, C. Rosé. 2017. Coordinating Collaborative Chat in Massive Open Online Courses. Abstract: An earlier study of a collaborative chat intervention in a Massive Open Online Course (MOOC) identified negative effects on attrition stemming from a requirement for students to be matched with exactly one partner prior to beginning the activity. That study raised questions about how to orchestrate a collaborative chat intervention in a MOOC context in order to provide the benefit of synchronous social engagement without the coordination difficulties. In this paper we present a careful analysis of an intervention designed to overcome coordination difficulties by welcoming students into the chat on a rolling basis as they arrive rather than requiring them to be matched with a partner before beginning. The results suggest the most positive impact when experiencing a chat with exactly one partner rather than more or less. A qualitative analysis of the chat data reveals differential experiences between these configurations that suggests a potential explanation for the effect and raises questions for future research.

Abstract: In this paper, we present a novel and highly effective method for induction and application of metaphor frame templates as a step toward detecting metaphor in extended discourse. We infer implicit facets of a given metaphor frame using a semi-supervised bootstrapping approach on an unlabeled corpus. Our model applies this frame facet information to metaphor detection, and achieves the state-of-the-art performance on a social media dataset when building upon other proven features in a nonlinear machine learning model. In addition, we illustrate the mechanism through which the frame and topic information enable the more accurate metaphor detection.

Abstract: The symposium focuses on the analysis of the knowledge building process e.g. idea improvement conversations by which students get to a high quality of knowledge and understanding. Learning Analytics (LA) focuses on the collection, measure and analysis of data about learners and their contexts (Long & Siemens, 2011). LA tools are normally rooted in probabilistic/frequency-based approaches. These are themselves incapable of capturing the meaning of texts at any level, because probabilities do not constitute natural language semantics. Therefore, semantic related analytics seems to be a promising approach. Not only to get insight in the process of knowledge building as a support for students and teachers in this collective process but also as a possibility for assessment. Not to control but to mirror and feed forward the semiotic collaborative process of building an understanding that makes a difference for how students look at and act in our world.
- Hyeju Jang, Yohan Jo, Qinlan Shen, Michael Miller Yoder, Seungwhan Moon, C. Rosé. 2016. Metaphor Detection with Topic Transition, Emotion and Cognition in Context. Abstract: Metaphor is a common linguistic tool in communication, making its detection in discourse a crucial task for natural language understanding. One popular approach to this challenge is to capture semantic incohesion between a metaphor and the dominant topic of the surrounding text. While these methods are effective, they tend to overclassify target words as metaphorical when they deviate in meaning from its context. We present a new approach that (1) distinguishes literal and non-literal use of target words by examining sentence-level topic transitions and (2) captures the motivation of speakers to express emotions and abstract concepts metaphorically. Experiments on an online breast cancer discussion forum dataset demonstrate a significant improvement in metaphor detection over the state-of-theart. These experimental results also reveal a tendency toward metaphor usage in personal topics and certain emotional contexts.

Abstract: This paper reviews work in progress towards bridging the field of linguistics and its operationalizations of discourse, and that of frameworks for studying collaborative learning that are rooted directly in the learning sciences.  We begin with the vision of a multi-dimensional coding and counting analysis approach that might serve as a boundary object between the variety of methodological approaches to analysis of collaborative learning that exist within the Learning Sciences.  We outline what we have discovered from a combination of hand coding, comparison with alternative analytic approaches including network analytic and qualitative approaches, correlational analyses in connection with learning-relevant extralinguistic variables, and computational modeling.  We explore both the contribution of work to date as well as the many remaining challenges.

From the now ubiquitous presence of intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) platforms providing large volumes of sensor data, to vast amounts of open source data in the form of news reports, blog postings, or social media postings, the amount of information available to a modern decision maker is staggering. Whether tasked with leading a military campaign or providing support for a humanitarian mission, being able to make sense of all the information available is a challenge. Due to the volume and velocity of this data, automated tools are required to help support reasoned, human decisions. In this paper we describe several automated techniques that are targeted at supporting decision making. Our approaches include modeling the kinematics of moving targets as motifs; developing normalcy models and detecting anomalies in kinematic data; automatically classifying the roles of users in social media; and modeling geo-spatial regions based on the behavior that takes place in them. These techniques cover a wide-range of potential decision maker needs.

Recently, there has been a surge of interest within the computational linguistics (CL) community in the social dimension of language. In this article we present a survey of the emerging field of “computational sociolinguistics” that reflects this increased interest. We aim to provide a comprehensive overview of CL research on sociolinguistic themes, featuring topics such as the relation between language and social identity, language use in social interaction, and multilingual communication. Moreover, we demonstrate the potential for synergy between the research communities involved, by showing how the large-scale data-driven methods that are widely used in CL can complement existing sociolinguistic studies, and how sociolinguistics can inform and challenge the methods and assumptions used in CL studies. We hope to convey the possible benefits of a closer collaboration between the two communities and conclude with a discussion of open challenges.

From Insights to Interventions: Informed Design of Discussion Affordances for Natural Collaborative Exchange. Abstract: Despite studies showing collaboration to be beneﬁcial both in terms of student satisfaction and learning, isolation is the norm in MOOCs. Two problems limiting the success of collaboration in MOOCs are the lack of support for team formation and structured collaboration support. Lack of support and strategies for team formation prevents teams from being set up for success from the beginning. Lack of structured support during synchronous collaboration has been demonstrated to produce signiﬁcantly less learning than supported collaboration. This paper describes a deliberation based team formation approach and a scripted collaboration framework for MOOCs aimed at addressing these problems under the um-brella of DANCE 1 whose overarching focus is the enhancement of team-based MOOCs. These two examples of current work have been used as illustrations of insights informing interventions in MOOCs.

Abstract: In the past two decades, the field of Machine Learning has not only greatly expanded in terms of the plethora of increasingly powerful modeling frameworks it has provided, but has also birthed the applied fields of Educational Data Mining and Learning Analytics. Learning Analytics has blossomed as an area in the Learning Sciences, promising impact for various stakeholders working at different educational levels, such as Instructional Designers, Students, Instructors, Policymakers and Administrators. This symposium offers a taste of cutting edge work across each of these levels, with a common emphasis on analytics applied to social processes.

Abstract: To create a satisfying social learning experience, an emerging challenge in educational data mining is to automatically assign students into effective learning teams. In this paper, we utilize discourse data mining as the foundation for an online team-formation procedure. The procedure features a deliberation process prior to team assignment, where participants hold discussions both to prepare for the collaboration task and provide indicators that are then used during automated team assignment. We automatically assign teams in a way that maximizes average observed pairwise transactivity exchange within teams, whereas in a control condition, teams are assigned randomly. We validate our team-formation procedure in a crowdsourced online environment that enables effective isolation of variables, namely Amazon’s Mechanical Turk. We compare group knowledge integration outcomes between the two team assignment conditions. Our results demonstrate that transactivity-based team assignment is associated with significantly greater knowledge integration (p < .05, effect size 3 standard deviations).
- W. B. Towne, C. Rosé, J. Herbsleb, James D. 2016. Measuring Similarity Similarly. Abstract: Several intelligent technologies designed to improve navigability in and digestibility of text corpora use topic modeling such as the state-of-the-art Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA). This model and variants on it provide lower-dimensional document representations used in visualizations and in computing similarity between documents. This article contributes a method for validating such algorithms against human perceptions of similarity, especially applicable to contexts in which the algorithm is intended to support navigability between similar documents via dynamically generated hyperlinks. Such validation enables researchers to ground their methods in context of intended use instead of relying on assumptions of fit. In addition to the methodology, this article presents the results of an evaluation using a corpus of short documents and the LDA algorithm. We also present some analysis of potential causes of differences between cases in which this model matches human perceptions of similarity more or less well.

Abstract: An important research problem for Educational Data Mining is to expedite the cycle of data leading to the analysis of student learning processes and the improvement of support for those processes. For this goal in the context of social interaction in learning, we propose a three-part pipeline that includes data infrastructure, learning process analysis with behavior modeling, and intervention for support. We also describe an application of the pipeline to data from a social learning platform to investigate appropriate goal-setting behavior as a qualification of role models. Students following appropriate goal setters persisted longer in the course, showed increased engagement in hands-on course activities, and were more likely to review previously covered materials as they continued through the course. To foster this beneficial social interaction among students, we propose a social recommender system and show potential for assisting students in interacting with qualified goal setters as role models. We discuss how this generalizable pipeline can be adapted for other support needs in online learning settings.

Building on Cultural Capacity for Innovation Through International Collaboration: In Memory of Naomi Miyake. Abstract: This symposium addresses issues of scaling up research-based educational reforms, with focus on the Japanese Knowledge Constructive Jigsaw initiative--a substantial achievement of Naomi Miyake and learning science colleagues in Japan. Scaling up procedures involve small networks of teachers, education leaders and researchers working together to design, practice, and improve lessons across subjects, schools and districts. The set of strategies developed provides a common Knowledge Constructive Jigsaw framework or set of “constraints” to guide the practices of participants for reflection on learning and to expand children’s potential to learn, teachers’ potential to support student learning, and policy makers’ potential to support teacher learning. Building Cultural Capacity for Innovation represents a vision shared by teams in Japan and internationally to transform schools into knowledge creating organizations, to learn from one another, and to—in Naomi’s words--support a science of practice deeply embedded in the learning sciences.
- Gaurav Singh Tomar, Sreecharan Sankaranarayanan, C. Rosé. 2016. Intelligent Conversational Agents as Facilitators and Coordinators for Group Work in Distributed Learning Environments (MOOCs). Abstract: Artiﬁcially intelligent conversational agents have been demonstrated to positively impact team based learning in classrooms and hold even greater potential for impact in the now widespread Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) if certain challenges can be overcome. These challenges include team formation, coordination and management of group processes in teams working together while distributed both in time and space. Our work begins with an architecture for orchestrating conversational agent based support for group learning called Bazaar, which has facilitated numerous successful studies of learning in the past including some early investigations in MOOC contexts. In this paper, we brieﬂy describe our experience in designing, developing and deploying agent supported collaborative learning activities in 3 different MOOCs in three iterations. Findings from this iterative design process provide an empirical foundation for a reusable framework for facilitating similar activities in future MOOCs.
- Xu Wang, Miaomiao Wen, C. Rosé. 2016. Towards triggering higher-order thinking behaviors in MOOCs. Abstract: With the aim of better scaffolding discussion to improve learning in a MOOC context, this work investigates what kinds of discussion behaviors contribute to learning. We explored whether engaging in higher-order thinking behaviors results in more learning than paying general or focused attention to course materials. In order to evaluate whether to attribute the effect to engagement in the associated behaviors versus persistent characteristics of the students, we adopted two approaches. First, we used propensity score matching to pair students who exhibit a similar level of involvement in other course activities. Second, we explored individual variation in engagement in higher-order thinking behaviors across weeks. The results of both analyses support the attribution of the effect to the behavioral interpretation. A further analysis using LDA applied to course materials suggests that more social oriented topics triggered richer discussion than more biopsychology oriented topics.

Abstract: Choosing an appropriate way for a spoken dialog system to initiate a conversation is a challenging problem, and, if done incorrectly, can negatively affect people’s performance on other important tasks. We describe the results of a study in which participants play a game and are inter-rupted by spoken notiﬁcations in different styles. We compare people’s perceptions of the notiﬁcation styles, as well as their effect on task performance. The different notiﬁcations include manipulations of pre-notiﬁcations and information about the urgency of the task. We ﬁnd that pre-notiﬁcations help people respond signiﬁ-cantly faster to urgent tasks, and that 43% of people, more than in any other category, prefer a notiﬁcation style in which the no-tiﬁcation begins by stating the urgency of the task.

Fostering Deliberative Discourse in Schools Towards the Constitution of a Deliberative Democracy. Abstract: This symposium focuses on forms of classroom discourse that have the potential to lead to societal change. The deployment of these forms of discourse that we designate as deliberative discourse provides unique moments during which a communicative rationalization is realized. We present very different programs in civic education, science, philosophy or history that realize this communicative rationalization. The common denominator of these programs is that they all provide long-term learning experiences. Through iterative enactment of collaborative inquiry and/or argumentative moves, students acquire norms that prepare them for the constitution of a deliberative democracy.
- Diyi Yang, R. Kraut, C. Rosé. 2016. Exploring the Effect of Student Confusion in Massive Open Online Courses. Abstract: Although thousands of students enroll in Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) for learning and self-improvement, many  get confused, harming learning and increasing dropout rates. In this paper, we quantify these effects in two large MOOCs. We first describe how we automatically estimate students' confusion by looking at their behavior clicking on course content and participating in the course discussion forums. We then apply survival analysis to quantify the impact of confusion on students' dropout. The results demonstrate that the more confusion students express themselves and the more they are exposed to other students' confusion, the sooner they drop out of the course. We also explore the effects of confusion expressed in different contexts and related to different aspects of courses. We conclude with implications for the design of interventions to improve student retention in MOOCs.

Abstract: An important research problem in learning analytics is to expedite the cycle of data leading to the analysis of student progress and the improvement of student support. For this goal in the context of social learning, we propose a pipeline that includes data infrastructure, learning analytics, and intervention, along with computational models for individual components. Next, we describe an example of applying this pipeline to real data in a case study, whose goal is to investigate the positive effects that goal-setting students have on their peers, which suggests ways in which we might foster these social benefits through intervention.

Abstract: Research has generated deep insights into computer-supported collaborative learning (CSCL), but the cycle of impact on practice is relatively lengthy and slow. In contrast, work in learning analytics attempts to leverage the collection and analysis of data to improve learning processes and outcomes in-situ. Developing learning analytics to support CSCL thus offers the opportunity to make our research actionable in an immediate way by using data collected on collaborative processes in-progress to inform their future trajectories. Efforts in this direction are specifically promising in support of students’ selfand socially sharedregulation of their learning. Data on collaborative and metacognitive activities can inform collaborating groups and help them to improve future joint efforts. In this symposium we bring together a collection of five papers that are exploring the space of connection between CSCL, learning analytics and self-regulation to advance thinking around these issues.
- Oliver Ferschke, Iris K. Howley, Gaurav Tomar, Diyi Yang, Yu Liu, C. Rosé. 2015. Fostering Discussion across Communication Media in Massive Open Online Courses. Abstract: This paper presents data from one cycle of a design based research process in which we grapple with challenges in engaging students in more intensive discussion based interactions in Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs). We compare across three communication media provided to students in that context in terms of relative popularity and overlap in student sub-populations. We also compare the communication between these contexts in terms of their content focus, concentration of reasoning articulation, and the interaction between the two. This comparison allows investigating the specific contribution of synchronous collaboration in a MOOC, which is relatively novel. The analysis suggests that there is value in providing a diverse set of discussion contexts in that they may lend themselves to differently natured interactions, but that it creates a need for greater efforts towards effective bridging between media and channeling of students to pockets of interaction that are potentially of personal benefit.

Abstract: An emerging field of educational data mining (EDM) is building on and contributing to a wide variety of disciplines through analysis of data coming from various educational technologies. EDM researchers are addressing questions of cognition, metacognition, motivation, affect, language, social discourse, etc. using data from intelligent tutoring systems, massive open online courses, educational games and simulations, and discussion forums. The data include detailed action and timing logs of student interactions in user interfaces such as graded responses to questions or essays, steps in rich problem solving environments, games or simulations, discussion forum posts, or chat dialogs. They might also include external sensors such as eye tracking, facial expression, body movement, etc. We review how EDM has addressed the research questions that surround the psychology of learning with an emphasis on assessment, transfer of learning and model discovery, the role of affect, motivation and metacognition on learning, and analysis of language data and collaborative learning. For example, we discuss (1) how different statistical assessment methods were used in a data mining competition to improve prediction of student responses to intelligent tutor tasks, (2) how better cognitive models can be discovered from data and used to improve instruction, (3) how data-driven models of student affect can be used to focus discussion in a dialog-based tutoring system, and (4) how machine learning techniques applied to discussion data can be used to produce automated agents that support student learning as they collaborate in a chat room or a discussion board.

Abstract: Cognitive Task Analysis (CTA) interview technique is commonly used to elicit knowledge of subject-matter experts and to design instruction better focused on what experts don’t know they know. However, the knowledge of how to conduct an effective interview is, itself, largely implicit. In this study we performed protocol analysis on a set of interview transcripts from an expert CTA practitioner to elicit the cognitive processes of conducting CTA interviews. We also consulted expert CTA practitioners to identify the strategies that they used during the interviews. We present key strategies that were employed by the expert CTA practitioners to ensure comprehensiveness and accuracy in the information collected, such as looking for perceptual cues (e.g. considering verbs such as “determine”) to ascertain adequacy of SME’s responses and selection of follow-up questions. We present a production rule model as a detailed description of the cognitive processes underlying expert CTA interviewing.

- Yohan Jo, N. Loghmanpour, C. Rosé. 2015. Time Series Analysis of Nursing Notes for Mortality Prediction via a State Transition Topic Model. Abstract: Accurate mortality prediction is an important task in intensive care units in order to channel prompt care to patients in the most critical condition and to reduce nurses' alarm fatigue. Nursing notes carry valuable information in this regard, but nothing has been reported about the effectiveness of temporal analysis of nursing notes in mortality prediction tasks. We propose a time series model that uncovers the temporal dynamics of patients' underlying states from nursing notes. The effectiveness of this information in mortality prediction is examined for mortality prediction for five different time spans ranging from one day to one year. Our experiments show that the model captures both patient states and their temporal dynamics that have a strong correlation with patient mortality. The results also show that incorporating temporal information improves performance in long-term mortality prediction, but has no significant effect in short-term prediction.

Abstract: The automatic generation of presentation slides from technical articles is one of the most desired but under-researched area in the ﬁeld of computing. Automated generation of slide contents from technical articles is much difﬁcult than a typical text summarization process, since it requires the identiﬁcation of all the crucial contents from the article and their arrangement in a systematic manner, thus making it a non trivial task. The process is considered to be one of the core applications of text mining. Automatic slide generators can be broadly clas-siﬁed based on NLP, Statistical Methods and Machine Learning. A detailed review of some of the most important automatic slide generation techniques from academic articles is presented and a brief comparison among the discussed techniques is given.
- Abhimanu Kumar, Shriphani Palakodety, Chong Wang, C. Rosé, E. Xing, Miaomiao Wen. 2015. Scalable Modeling of Conversational-role based Self-presentation Characteristics in Large Online Forums. Abstract: Online discussion forums are complex webs of overlapping subcommunities (macrolevel structure, across threads) in which users enact different roles depending on which subcommunity they are participating in within a particular time point (microlevel structure, within threads). This sub-network structure is implicit in massive collections of threads. To uncover this structure, we develop a scalable algorithm based on stochastic variational inference and leverage topic models (LDA) along with mixed membership stochastic block (MMSB) models. We evaluate our model on three large-scale datasets, Cancer-ThreadStarter (22K users and 14.4K threads), Cancer-NameMention(15.1K users and 12.4K threads) and StackOverFlow (1.19 million users and 4.55 million threads). Qualitatively, we demonstrate that our model can provide useful explanations of microlevel and macrolevel user presentation characteristics in different communities using the topics discovered from posts. Quantitatively, we show that our model does better than MMSB and LDA in predicting user reply structure within threads. In addition, we demonstrate via synthetic data experiments that the proposed active sub-network discovery model is stable and recovers the original parameters of the experimental setup with high probability.
- Xu Wang, Diyi Yang, Miaomiao Wen, K. Koedinger, C. Rosé. 2015. Investigating How Student's Cognitive Behavior in MOOC Discussion Forum Affect Learning Gains. Abstract: While MOOCs undoubtedly provide valuable learning resources for students, little research in the MOOC context has sought to evaluate students’ learning gains in the environment. It has been long acknowledged that conversation is a significant way for students to construct knowledge and learn. However, rather than studying learning in MOOC discussion forums, the thrust of current research in that context has been to identify factors that predict dropout. Thus, cognitively relevant student behavior in the forums has not been evaluated for its impact on cognitive processes and learning. In this paper, we adopt a content analysis approach to analyze students’ cognitively relevant behaviors in a MOOC discussion forum and further explore the relationship between the quantity and quality of that participation with their learning gains. As an integral part of our approach, we built a computational model to automate the analysis so that it is possible to extend the content analysis to all communication that occurred in the MOOC. We identified significant associations between discourse behavior and learning. Theoretical and practical implications are discussed.
- Hyeju Jang, Miaomiao Wen, C. Rosé. 2015. Effects of Situational Factors on Metaphor Detection in an Online Discussion Forum. Abstract: Accurate metaphor detection remains an open challenge. In this paper, we explore a new type of clue for disambiguating terms that may be used metaphorically or literally in an online medical support community. In particular, we investigate the influence of situational factors on propensity to employ the metaphorical sense of words when they can be used to illustrate the emotion behind the experience of the event. Specifically we consider the experience of stressful illness-related events in a poster’s recent history as situational factors. We evaluate the positive impact of automatically extracted cancer events on a metaphor detection task using data from an online cancer forum. We also provide a discussion of specific associations between events and metaphors, such asjourney with diagnosis orwarrior with chemotherapy.
- Diyi Yang, Miaomiao Wen, C. Rosé. 2015. Weakly Supervised Role Identification in Teamwork Interactions. Abstract: In this paper, we model conversational roles in terms of distributions of turn level behaviors, including conversation acts and stylistic markers, as they occur over the whole interaction. This work presents a lightly supervised approach to inducing role definitions over sets of contributions within an extended interaction, where the supervision comes in the form of an outcome measure from the interaction. The identified role definitions enable a mapping from behavior profiles of each participant in an interaction to limited sized feature vectors that can be used effectively to predict the teamwork outcome. An empirical evaluation applied to two Massive Open Online Course (MOOCs) datasets demonstrates that this approach yields superior performance in learning representations for predicting the teamwork outcome over several baselines.
- Hyeju Jang, Seungwhan Moon, Yohan Jo, C. Rosé. 2015. Metaphor Detection in Discourse. Abstract: Understanding contextual information is key to detecting metaphors in discourse. Most current work aims at detecting metaphors given a single sentence, thus focusing mostly on local contextual cues within a short text. In this paper, we present a novel approach that explicitly leverages global context of a discourse to detect metaphors. In addition, we show that syntactic information such as dependency structures can help better describe local contextual information, thus improving detection results when combined. We apply our methods on a newly annotated online discussion forum, and show that our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art baselines in previous literature.
- Marcela Borge, Yann Shiou Ong, C. Rosé. 2015. Activity Design Models to Support the Development of High Quality Collaborative Processes in Online Settings. Abstract: In this paper we assess the utility of an activity design model and different reflective activities for improving the quality of collaborative processes. Thirty-seven online students, belonging to one of 13 teams, formed the participants of the study. Teams completed five discussion sessions as part of required course activity, using one of two reflective conditions. Each team also received feedback on their performance. We assessed the quality of processes between groups using content analysis techniques. Team process measures at the first time point were used to identify groups’ initial strengths and weaknesses. To assess the utility of the model and reflective assessment designs, we used a 2x5 mixed factorial design, with Condition (two levels) as a between subjects factor and Time (5 levels) as a within subjects factor. We found that students were weakest at presenting and discussing claims and both Condition and Time are significant predictors of collaborative process quality.

Abstract: Thousands of students enroll in Massive Open Online Courses~(MOOCs) to seek opportunities for learning and self-improvement. However, the learning process often involves struggles with confusion, which may have an adverse effect on the course participation experience, leading to dropout along the way. In this paper, we quantify that effect. We describe a classification model using discussion forum behavior and clickstream data to automatically identify posts that express confusion. We then apply survival analysis to quantify the impact of confusion on student dropout. The results demonstrate that the more confusion students express or are exposed to, the lower the probability of their retention. Receiving support and resolution of confusion helps mitigate this effect. We explore the differential effects of confusion expressed in different contexts and related to different aspects of courses. We conclude with implications for design of interventions towards improving the retention of students in MOOCs.

Identifying those patterns through clickstream analysis could enable more effective personalized support for student information seeking and learning in that online context. We propose a novel method to characterize types of sessions in MOOCs by mining the habitual behaviors of students within individual sessions. We model learning sessions as a distribution of activities and activity sequences with a topical N-gram model. The representation offers insights into what groupings of habitual student behaviors are associated with higher or lower success in the course. We also investigate how context information, such as time of day or a user's demographic information, is associated with the types of learning sessions.

Abstract: The unique social presence of robots can be leveraged in learning situations to reduce student evaluation anxiety, while still providing instructional guidance. Furthermore, social role of the instructor can also impact the prevalence of evaluation apprehension. In this study, we examine how human and robot social role affects help-seeking behaviors and learning outcomes in a one-on-one tutoring setting. Our results show that help-seeking is a moderator of the relationship between condition and learning, with the “human teacher” condition resulting in significantly less learning (and marginally less help-seeking) than the “human assistant” and both robot conditions.

- Rohit Kumar, C. Rosé. 2014. Triggering effective social support for online groups. Abstract: Conversational agent technology is an emerging paradigm for creating a social environment in online groups that is conducive to effective teamwork. Prior work has demonstrated advantages in terms of learning gains and satisfaction scores when groups learning together online have been supported by conversational agents that employ Balesian social strategies. This prior work raises two important questions that are addressed in this article. The first question is one of generality. Specifically, are the positive effects of the designed support specific to learning contexts? Or are they in evidence in other collaborative task domains as well? We present a study conducted within a collaborative decision-making task where we see that the positive effects of the Balesian social strategies extend to this new context. The second question is whether it is possible to increase the effectiveness of the Balesian social strategies by increasing the context sensitivity with which the social strategies are triggered. To this end, we present technical work that increases the sensitivity of the triggering. Next, we present a user study that demonstrates an improvement in performance of the support agent with the new, more sensitive triggering policy over the baseline approach from prior work.
 The technical contribution of this article is that we extend prior work where such support agents were modeled using a composition of conversational behaviors integrated within an event-driven framework. Within the present approach, conversation is orchestrated through context-sensitive triggering of the composed behaviors. The core effort involved in applying this approach involves building a set of triggering policies that achieve this orchestration in a time-sensitive and coherent manner. In line with recent developments in data-driven approaches for building dialog systems, we present a novel technique for learning behavior-specific triggering policies, deploying it as part of our efforts to improve a socially capable conversational tutor agent that supports collaborative learning.

- Hyeju Jang, Mario Piergallini, Miaomiao Wen, C. Rosé. 2014. Conversational Metaphors in Use: Exploring the Contrast between Technical and Everyday Notions of Metaphor. Abstract: Much computational work has been done on identifying and interpreting the meaning of metaphors, but little work has been done on understanding the motivation behind the use of metaphor. To computationally model discourse and social positioning in metaphor, we need a corpus annotated with metaphors relevant to speaker intentions. This paper reports a corpus study as a first step towards computational work on social and discourse functions of metaphor. We use Amazon Mechanical Turk (MTurk) to annotate data from three web discussion forums covering distinct domains. We then compare these to annotations from our own annotation scheme which distinguish levels of metaphor with the labels: nonliteral, conventionalized, and literal. Our hope is that this work raises questions about what new work needs to be done in order to address the question of how metaphors are used to achieve social goals in interaction.
- Miaomiao Wen, Diyi Yang, C. Rosé. 2014. Sentiment Analysis in MOOC Discussion Forums: What does it tell us?. Abstract: Sentiment analysis is one of the great accomplishments of the last decade in the field of Language Technologies. In this paper, we explore mining collective sentiment from forum posts in a Massive Open Online Course (MOOC) in order to monitor students’ trending opinions towards the course and major course tools, such as lecture and peer-assessment. We observe a correlation between sentiment ratio measured based on daily forum posts and number of students who drop out each day. On a user-level, we evaluate the impact of sentiment on attrition over time. A qualitative analysis clarifies the subtle differences in how these language behaviors are used in practice across three MOOCs. Implications for research and practice are discussed.
- Diyi Yang, Miaomiao Wen, Abhimanu Kumar, E. Xing, C. Rosé. 2014. Towards an Integration of Text and Graph Clustering Methods as a Lens for Studying Social Interaction in MOOCs. Abstract: In this paper, we describe a novel methodology, grounded in techniques from the field of machine learning, for modeling emerging social structure as it develops in threaded discussion forums, with an eye towards application in the threaded discussions of massive open online courses (MOOCs). This modeling approach integrates two simpler, well established prior techniques, namely one related to social network structure and another related to thematic structure of text. As an illustrative application of the integrated technique’s use and utility, we use it as a lens for exploring student dropout behavior in three different MOOCs. In particular, we use the model to identify twenty emerging subcommunities within the threaded discussions of each of the three MOOCs. We then use a survival model to measure the impact of participation in identified subcommunities on attrition along the way for students who have participated in the course discussion forums of the three courses. In each of three MOOCs we find evidence that participation in two to four subcommunities out of the twenty is associated with significantly higher or lower dropout rates than average. A qualitative post-hoc analysis illustrates how the learned models can be used as a lens for understanding the values and focus of discussions within the subcommunities, and in the illustrative example to think about the association between those and detected higher or lower dropout rates than average in the three courses. Our qualitative analysis demonstrates that the patterns that emerge make sense: It associates evidence of stronger expressed motivation to actively participate in the course as well as evidence of stronger cognitive engagement with the material in subcommunities associated with lower attrition, and the opposite in subcommunities associated with higher attrition. We conclude with a discussion of ways the modeling approach might be applied, along with caveats from limitations, and directions for future work.

Abstract: In this paper, we present a series of experiments in which we analyze the usage of graffiti style features for signaling personal gang identification in a large, online street gangs forum, with an accuracy as high as 83% at the gang alliance level and 72% for the specific gang. We then build on that result in predicting how members of different gangs signal the relationship between their gangs within threads where they are interacting with one another, with a predictive accuracy as high as 66% at this thread composition prediction task. Our work demonstrates how graffiti style features signal social identity both in terms of personal group affiliation and between group alliances and oppositions. When we predict thread composition by modeling identity and relationship simultaneously using a multi-domain learning framework paired with a rich feature representation, we achieve significantly higher predictive accuracy than state-of-the-art baselines using one or the other in isolation.

 While data from Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) offers the potential to gain new insights into the ways in which online communities can contribute to student learning, much of the richness of the data trace is still yet to be mined. In particular, very little work has attempted fine-grained content analyses of the student interactions in MOOCs. Survey research indicates the importance of student goals and intentions in keeping them involved in a MOOC over time.  Automated fine-grained content analyses offer the potential to detect and monitor evidence of student engagement and how it relates to other aspects of their behavior. Ultimately these indicators reflect their commitment to remaining in the course.  As a methodological contribution, in this paper we investigate using computational linguistic models to measure learner motivation and cognitive engagement from the text of forum posts.  We validate our techniques using survival models that evaluate the predictive validity of these variables in connection with attrition over time. We conduct this evaluation in three MOOCs focusing on very different types of learning materials. Prior work demonstrates that participation in the discussion forums at all is a strong indicator of student commitment. Our methodology allows us to differentiate better among these students, and to identify danger signs that a struggling student is in need of support within a population whose interaction with the course offers the opportunity for effective support to be administered.  Theoretical and practical implications will be discussed.
 

- Diyi Yang, Mario Piergallini, Iris K. Howley, C. Rosé. 2014. Forum Thread Recommendation for Massive Open Online Courses. Abstract: Recently, Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) have garnered a high level of interest in the media. With larger and larger numbers of students participating in each course, finding useful and informative threads in increasingly crowded course discussion forums becomes a challenging issue for students. In this work, we address this thread overload problem by taking advantage of an adaptive feature-based matrix factorization framework to make thread recommendations. A key component of our approach is a feature space design that effectively characterizes student behaviors in the forum in order to match threads and users. This effort includes content level modeling, social peer connections, and other forum activities. The results from our experiment conducted on one MOOC course show promise that our thread recommendation method has potential to direct students to threads they might be interested in.

Many of the techniques now prominent from practitioners have been drawn from various fields, including HCI, statistics, computer science, and learning sciences. In order for LA to grow and advance as a discipline, two significant challenges must be met: 1) development of analytics methods and techniques that are native to the LA discipline, and 2) practitioners in LA to develop algorithms and models that reflect the social and computational dimensions of analytics. This workshop introduces researchers in learning analytics to machine learning (ML) and the opportunities that ML can provide in building next generation analysis models.
- C. Rosé, George Siemens. 2014. Shared Task on Prediction of Dropout Over Time in Massively Open Online Courses. Abstract: The shared task on Prediction of Dropout Over Time in MOOCs involves analysis of data from 6 MOOCs offered through Coursera. Data from one MOOC with approximately 30K students was distributed as training data and consisted of discussion forum data (in SQL) and clickstream data (in JSON format). The prediction task was Predicting Attrition Over Time. Based on behavioral data from a week’s worth of activity in a MOOC for a student, predict whether the student will cease to actively participate after that week. This paper describes the task. A full write up of the results is published separately (Rose & Siemens, 2014).

Abstract: : Current assessment instruments for socio-emotional skills typically focus on diagnosing dysfunction and need to be administered by teachers and parents. To explore socio-emotional learning in novel environments, the learning sciences community needs scalable, easy-to-administer research instruments that measure growth in normal children. In this paper, we report on an iterative design process and a series of validation studies for a story-based multiple-choice assessment tool that can be used efficiently by researchers in large-scale evaluations of technology-based socio-emotional learning (SEL) environments.
- Diyi Yang, Miaomiao Wen, C. Rosé. 2014. Peer Influence on Attrition in Massively Open Online Courses. Abstract: In this work, we investigate the role of relational bonds in keeping students engaged in online courses. Specifically, we quantify the manner in which students who demonstrate similar behavior patterns influence each other’s commitment to the course through their interaction with them either explicitly or implicitly. To this end, we design five alternative operationalizations of relationship bonds, which together allow us to infer a scaled measure of relationship between pairs of students. Using this, we construct three variables, namely number of significant bonds, number of significant bonds with people who have dropped out in the previous week, and number of such bonds with people who have dropped in the current week. Using a survival analysis, we are able to measure the prediction strength of these variables with respect to dropout at each time point. Results indicate that higher numbers of significant bonds predicts lower rates of dropout; while loss of significant bonds is associated with higher rates of dropout.
- Diyi Yang, Jingbo Shang, C. Rosé. 2014. Constrained Question Recommendation in MOOCs via Submodularity. Abstract: A recent area in which recommender systems have shown their value is in online discussion forums and question-answer sites. Earlier work in this space has focused on the problem of matching participants to opportunities but has not adequately addressed the problem that in these social contexts, multiple dimensions of constraints must be satisfied, including limitations on capacity and minimal requirements for expertise. In this work, we propose such a constrained question recommendation problem with load balance constraints in discussion forums and use flow based model to generate the optimal solution. In particular, to address the introduced computation complexity, we investigate the concept of submodularity of the objective function and propose a specific submodular method to give an approximated solution. We present experiments conducted on two Massive Open Online Course (MOOC) discussion forum datasets, and demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our submodular method in solving constrained question recommendation tasks.

Abstract: We combine corpus driven linguistic knowledge with experimentally obtained sensorimotor data in an effort to better specify the minimum conceptual representation of a motion event that distinguishes it from all other events, which still are largely presented in a vague and not objectively calculated quantitative method. We use American English and Modern Greek data as a case study, in order to focus on the clustering of motor actions and its correspondence to previous linguistic classifications of both languages.

Towards Optimization of Macrocognitive Processes: Automating Analysis of the Emergence of Leadership in Ad Hoc Teams. Abstract: Abstract : An important focus for technical research related to machine learning has been to address not only generalization across sub-community structures within a hierarchical dataset, but also accommodating changes over time in a longitudinal dataset using evolving behavior models. We have two prototype models built and working and are extending that work to make it more scalable to larger datasets. We completed a highly scalable model, being able to be applied to networks with millions of users. We validated the model on 3 different data sets from Massive Open Online Courses and found that the sub-community structure identified by the algorithm was predictive of differences in dropout rate between subsets of students.
- Diyi Yang, Miaomiao Wen, C. Rosé. 2014. Towards Identifying the Resolvability of Threads in MOOCs. Abstract: One important function of the discussion forums of Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) is for students to post problems they are unable to resolve and receive help from their peers and instructors. There are a large proportion of threads that are not resolved to the satisfaction of the students for various reasons. In this paper, we attack this problem by firstly constructing a conceptual model validated using a Structural Equation Modeling technique, which enables us to understand the factors that influence whether a problem thread is satisfactorily resolved. We then demonstrate the robustness of these findings using a predictive model that illustrates how accurately those factors can be used to predict whether a thread is resolved or unresolved. Experiments conducted on one MOOC show that thread resolveability connects closely to our proposed five dimensions and that the predictive ensemble model gives better performance over several baselines.
- Diyi Yang, David Adamson, C. Rosé. 2014. Question recommendation with constraints for massive open online courses. Abstract: Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) have experienced a recent boom in interest. Problems students struggle with in the discussion forums, such as difficultly in finding interesting discussion opportunities or attracting helpers to address posted problems, provide new opportunities for recommender systems. In contrast to traditional product recommendation, question recommendation in discussion forums should simultaneously consider constraints on both students and questions. These considerations include (1) Load Balancing - students should not be over-burdened with too many requests; and (2) Expertise Matching - students should not be requested to address problems they are not capable of addressing. In this work, we formulate a novel constrained question recommendation problem to address the above considerations. We design a context-aware matrix factorization model to predict students' preferences over questions, then build a max cost flow model to manage the constraints. Experimental results conducted on three MOOC datasets demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms baseline methods in optimizing overall forum welfare, and in predicting which specific questions students might be interested in.

Abstract: We report on findings generated by a new method of quantified discourse analysis aimed at capturing qualities of mathematical talk according to Sfard’s (2008) “communicational framework”. The method is inspired by Systemic Functional Linguistic system of ‘Transitivity’. Findings revealed significant differences between two instructors' mathematical talk in a teachers’ college course. These differences were mainly seen in the amount of ‘objectified’ vs. ‘personified’ talk of each of the instructors.

Abstract: We present a system for extracting the dates of illness events (year and month of the event occurrence) from posting histories in the context of an online medical support community. A temporal tagger retrieves and normalizes dates mentioned informally in social media to actual month and year referents. Building on this, an event date extraction system learns to integrate the likelihood of candidate dates extracted from time-rich sentences with temporal constraints extracted from eventrelated sentences. Our integrated model achieves 89.7% of the maximum performance given the performance of the temporal expression retrieval step.
- Iris K. Howley, Elijah Mayfield, C. Rosé. 2013. Linguistic Analysis Methods for Studying Small Groups. Abstract: Introduction Linguistic analysis of collaboration is a research area with stakeholders from multiple fields, including learning sciences, organizational behavior, sociolinguistics and other areas of linguistics, language technologies and machine learning, social psychology, and sociology. Each field brings with it its own valuable store of wisdom as well as its own sets of research questions and methodologies that bring out different subsets of facets. While we view collaboration from a multidisciplinary perspective, we adopt a technical definition of what linguistic analysis is, specifically an analysis that employs constructs from the field of linguistics that are designed to study language as a primary focus of inquiry. While a wide variety of valuable frameworks for studying the language of collaboration have been developed within the learning sciences community, instead of considering these linguistic analyses of collaboration per se, we consider them applications of theoretical constructs from the learning sciences to language interactions. The focus is on learning processes viewed through language rather than the language processes themselves. The advantage of a linguistic framework is that it allows us to avoid making a commitment to one specific theoretical perspective within the learning sciences. Within the broad field of linguistics, we focus on a specific subcommunity referred to as Systemic Functional Linguistics. The field of systemic functional linguistics is a largely descriptive linguistic tradition that provides a firm foundation in analyses of genres of writing or text-based interaction (Martin & Rose, 2007; Martin & White, 2005), as well as face-to-face interaction (Veel, 1999), characterized in terms of the choices authors and speakers make about how to present themselves through language (Halliday, 1994). The choices that authors and 2 speakers make are mapped out in decision tree representations referred to as systems, which is where it gets its name. The constructs coming from the field of systemic functional linguistics provide us with a common foundation for exploring stylistic norms of conversational behavior across genres of dialogic interactions. What makes it an ideal choice for our efforts is the historical fact that it grew up side-by-side with one of the few sociological theories that was informed by linguistic data. As such, in contrast to other existing linguistic theories, it was fashioned specifically for the purpose of explaining sociological processes at multiple levels and within a wide range of contexts. Beyond these social phenomena, mechanisms such as grammatical metaphor (Halliday, 1994) endow it with the ability to represent …
- Mahesh Joshi, Mark Dredze, William W. Cohen, C. Rosé. 2013. What’s in a Domain? Multi-Domain Learning for Multi-Attribute Data. Abstract: Multi-Domain learning assumes that a single metadata attribute is used in order to divide the data into so-called domains. However, real-world datasets often have multiple metadata attributes that can divide the data into domains. It is not always apparent which single attribute will lead to the best domains, and more than one attribute might impact classification. We propose extensions to two multi-domain learning techniques for our multi-attribute setting, enabling them to simultaneously learn from several metadata attributes. Experimentally, they outperform the multi-domain learning baseline, even when it selects the single “best” attribute.

- G. Dyke, David Adamson, Iris K. Howley, C. Rosé. 2013. Enhancing Scientific Reasoning and Discussion with Conversational Agents. Abstract: This paper investigates the use of conversational agents to scaffold online collaborative learning discussions through an approach called academically productive talk (APT). In contrast to past work on dynamic support for collaborative learning, which has involved using agents to elevate the conceptual depth of collaborative discussion by leading students in groups through directed lines of reasoning, this APT-based approach lets students follow their own lines of reasoning and promotes productive practices such as explanation of reasoning and refinement of ideas. Two forms of support are contrasted, namely, Revoicing support and Feedback support. The study provides evidence that Revoicing support resulted in significantly more intensive reasoning exchange between students in the chat and significantly more learning during the chat than when that form of support was absent. Another form of support, namely, Feedback support increased expression of reasoning while marginally decreasing the intensity of the interaction between students and did not affect learning.
- David Adamson, C. Rosé. 2013. Academically Productive Talk: One Size Does Not Fit All. Abstract: We present a study in which we experimentally manipulate the form of support offered to groups of three students during collaborative learning. Specifically, we contrast two forms of Academically Productive Talk (APT) facilitation, known as Revoicing and Agree-Disagree. The first form has been demonstrated effective with the target age group (i.e., 9 th grade) on an earlier more difficult unit. The second form has been demonstrated effective with older kids. Results suggest that with this age group, facilitation with Revoicing may be more effective than Agree-Disagree. Implications for future work are discussed.

Abstract: In addition to their ability to reach distant learners, interactive e-learning environments have the potential to make the teaching-learning process more effective. This paper highlights some of the e-learning implementation efforts at the Addis Ababa Institute of Technology (AAiT) in Ethiopia. This case study shows that limited resources do not deter a developing nation from exploiting the power of e-learning. Based on feedback from participants in the first national videoconferencing program held in Ethiopian higher education system between October 2011 and June 2012, the paper addresses the lessons learned and recommended actions for moving forward to a successful implementation of e-learning in Ethiopia, particularly in a videoconferencing mode.

Abstract: Accountable Talk is a form of classroom interaction that positions students as thinkers in interaction and encourages students to make their thinking visible for collaborative reasoning. This paper reports on a two-year teacher professional development program in which teachers were coached to use Accountable Talk practices in their classrooms. Online collaborative learning activities were used to prepare students for these whole-class, teacher lead discussions using the same paradigm. Findings from a series of studies embedded within the two year professional development program provides evidence that novel conversational agent designs, based on the Accountable Talk approach to discussion facilitation, improve learning during the online exercises and better prepare students to benefit from whole class discussions. In this paper we evaluate the effect on teacher uptake of Accountable Talk practices when their students have participated in these online small group activities.
- Kristine Lund, C. Rosé, D. Suthers. 2013. Running Head : Epistemological Encounters Chapter 34-1 Epistemological Encounters in Multivocal Settings. Abstract: for e-Book ONLY!) Researchers usually work and evolve in the scientific frameworks in which they were trained, without questioning their epistemological foundations. However, this may be required when researchers coming from different disciplines and paradigms try to work together on the same object of study. This chapter reflects on epistemological encounters in a five-year project of multidisciplinary collaborations in the analysis of interaction. We argue for maintaining diversity of epistemological traditions while either achieving complementarity within explanatory frameworks on different levels or maintaining productive tension. We then present the extent to which researchers in our project and a similar project encountered each other’s epistemologies when they compared their analyses of shared corpora. The majority of comparisons in various contexts led to engagement between epistemologies and some of these epistemological encounters were productive and glitch free, others had difficulties, but still led to productivity, while still others led to missed opportunities and in one case to radicalizing incommensurable stances. A minority of comparisons in other contexts did not lead to engagement, but could either still be fruitful or not productive at all. In conclusion, we summarize the consequences of engaging with epistemologies through the comparisons researchers make of their analyses in multivocal contexts, showing how epistemological encounters can help to bridge between isolated traditions that work on similar objects of study.

Abstract: In this paper, we explore student dropout behavior in Massive Open Online Courses(MOOC). We use as a case study a recent Coursera class from which we develop a survival model that allows us to measure the influence of factors extracted from that data on student dropout rate. Specifically we explore factors related to student behavior and social positioning within discussion forums using standard social network analytic techniques. The analysis reveals several significant predictors of dropout.
- Elijah Mayfield, David Adamson, C. Rosé. 2013. Recognizing Rare Social Phenomena in Conversation: Empowerment Detection in Support Group Chatrooms. Abstract: Automated annotation of social behavior in conversation is necessary for large-scale analysis of real-world conversational data. Important behavioral categories, though, are often sparse and often appear only in specific subsections of a conversation. This makes supervised machine learning difficult, through a combination of noisy features and unbalanced class distributions. We propose within-instance content selection, using cue features to selectively suppress sections of text and biasing the remaining representation towards minority classes. We show the effectiveness of this technique in automated annotation of empowerment language in online support group chatrooms. Our technique is significantly more accurate than multiple baselines, especially when prioritizing high precision.

Abstract: In recent years, intelligent conversational agents have been used with some level of effectiveness as dynamic support for collaborative learning in online chat. The classroom discourse community offers insights from analysis of effective classroom discussion facilitation practices that might productively inspire the design of such facilitator agents. In this paper, we evaluate one such conversational agent-as-facilitator design, drawn from the literature on what has been termed Academically Productive Talk. Specifically we evaluate the effect of a facilitation strategy referred to as Agree/Disagree, where students are prompted to evaluate the assertions of a partner student. In a simple two condition study, we evaluate the effect of this facilitation strategy in comparison with an otherwise identical condition where this facilitation strategy is absent. The results demonstrate a marginal positive effect on learning (effect size .55 standard deviations) and a significant intensification effect on the collaborative discourse.
- Elijah Mayfield, Miaomiao Wen, M. Golant, C. Rosé. 2012. Discovering habits of effective online support group chatrooms. Abstract: For users of online support groups, prior research has suggested that a positive social environment is a key enabler of coping. Typically, demonstrating such claims about social interaction would be approached through the lens of sentiment analysis. In this work, we argue instead for a multifaceted view of emotional state, which incorporates both a static view of emotion (sentiment) with a dynamic view based on the behaviors present in a text. We codify this dynamic view through data annotations marking information sharing, sentiment, and coping efficacy. Through machine learning analysis of these annotations, we demonstrate that while sentiment predicts a user's stress at the beginning of a chat, dynamic views of efficacy are stronger indicators of stress reduction.

Abstract: This paper presents an automatic analysis method that enables efficient examination of participant behavior trajectories in online communities, which offers the opportunity to examine behavior over time at a level of granularity that has previously only been possible in small scale case study analyses. We provide an empirical validation of its performance. We then illustrate how this method offers insights into behavior patterns that enable avoiding faulty oversimplified assumptions about participation, such as that it follows a consistent trend over time. In particular, we use this method to investigate the connection between user behavior and distressful cancer events and demonstrate how this tool could assist in cancer story summarization.
- Elijah Mayfield, David Adamson, C. Rosé. 2012. Hierarchical Conversation Structure Prediction in Multi-Party Chat. Abstract: Conversational practices do not occur at a single unit of analysis. To understand the interplay between social positioning, information sharing, and rhetorical strategy in language, various granularities are necessary. In this work we present a machine learning model for multi-party chat which predicts conversation structure across differing units of analysis. First, we mark sentence-level behavior using an information sharing annotation scheme. By taking advantage of Integer Linear Programming and a sociolinguistic framework, we enforce structural relationships between sentence-level annotations and sequences of interaction. Then, we show that clustering these sequences can effectively disentangle the threads of conversation. This model is highly accurate, performing near human accuracy, and performs analysis on-line, opening the door to real-time analysis of the discourse of conversation.

Abstract: This chapter presents a detailed study of patterns of verbal interaction in a classroom context. In doing so it extends an important previously developed construct for analysis of productive talk for learning originating within the collaborative learning and intelligent tutoring communities, namely that of transactivity. Specifically, our focus is on argumentation and consensus building processes, which are key processes employed through language by communities in order to define themselves, maintain themselves, and evolve. We motivate the use of this construct for analysis of classroom discussions, describe our analysis framework with examples, and discuss current directions related to automatic analysis of classroom discussions using our transactivity based framework.

Abstract: Automatic assessment of group processes in collaborative groups is one of the holy grails of the computer supported collaborative learning community. In this paper, we present work towards detecting one type of group process which provides an important window into the inner workings of a group, namely “idea co-construction (ICC)”. What is unique about our approach in relation to other educational data mining techniques is that we adopt insights from sociolinguistic theories by modeling stylistic convergence of speech. We present an unsupervised machine learning technique that is able to generate a predictor of the prevalence of ICC in face-to-face debates with an R 2 value of .13, p < .05.

In contrast to past work on dynamic support for collaborative learning, which has involved using agents to elevate the conceptual depth of collaborative discussion by leading students in groups through directed lines of reasoning, this APT based approach lets students follow their own lines of reasoning and promotes productive practices such as deep explaination and refinement of ideas. The study provides evidence that one form of the support, namely the Revoicing support, lead to significantly more learning within an online collaborative learning activity and resulted in higher quality explanations for predictions within that session.
- Mahesh Joshi, Mark Dredze, William W. Cohen, C. Rosé. 2012. Multi-Domain Learning: When Do Domains Matter?. Abstract: We present a systematic analysis of existing multi-domain learning approaches with respect to two questions. First, many multidomain learning algorithms resemble ensemble learning algorithms. (1) Are multi-domain learning improvements the result of ensemble learning effects? Second, these algorithms are traditionally evaluated in a balanced class label setting, although in practice many multi-domain settings have domain-specific class label biases. When multi-domain learning is applied to these settings, (2) are multidomain methods improving because they capture domain-specific class biases? An understanding of these two issues presents a clearer idea about where the field has had success in multi-domain learning, and it suggests some important open questions for improving beyond the current state of the art.
- Guang Xiang, Zeyu Zheng, Miaomiao Wen, Jason I. Hong, C. Rosé, Chao Liu. 2012. A Supervised Approach to Predict Company Acquisition with Factual and Topic Features Using Profiles and News Articles on TechCrunch. Abstract: 
 
 Merger and Acquisition (M&A) prediction has been an interesting and challenging research topic in the past a few decades. However, past work has only adopted numerical features in building models, and yet the valuable textual information from the great variety of social media sites has not been touched at all. To fully explore this information, we used the profiles and news articles for companies and people on TechCrunch, the leading and largest public database for the tech world, which anybody can edit. Specifically, we explored topic features via topic modeling techniques, as well as a set of other novel features of our design within a machine learning framework. We conducted experiments of the largest scale in the literature, and achieved a high true positive rate (TP) between 60% to 79.8% with a false positive rate (FP) mostly between 0% and 8.3% over company categories with a small number of missing attributes in the CrunchBase profiles.
 

- Mahaveer Jain, J. McDonough, G. Gweon, B. Raj, C. Rosé. 2012. An Unsupervised Dynamic Bayesian Network Approach to Measuring Speech Style Accommodation. Abstract: Speech style accommodation refers to shifts in style that are used to achieve strategic goals within interactions. Models of stylistic shift that focus on specific features are limited in terms of the contexts to which they can be applied if the goal of the analysis is to model socially motivated speech style accommodation. In this paper, we present an unsupervised Dynamic Bayesian Model that allows us to model stylistic style accommodation in a way that is agnostic to which specific speech style features will shift in a way that resembles socially motivated stylistic variation. This greatly expands the applicability of the model across contexts. Our hypothesis is that stylistic shifts that occur as a result of social processes are likely to display some consistency over time, and if we leverage this insight in our model, we will achieve a model that better captures inherent structure within speech.
- Karthik Dinakar, Birago Jones, H. Lieberman, Rosalind W. Picard, C. Rosé, Matthew Thoman, Roi Reichart. 2012. You Too?! Mixed-Initiative LDA Story Matching to Help Teens in Distress. Abstract: 
 
 Adolescent cyber-bullying on social networks is a phenomenon that has received widespread attention. Recent work by sociologists has examined this phenomenon under the larger context of teenage drama and it's manifestations on social networks. Tackling cyber-bullying involves two key components – automatic detection of possible cases, and interaction strategies that encourage reflection and emotional support. Key is showing distressed teenagers that they are not alone in their plight. Conventional topic spotting and document classification into labels like "dating" or "sports" are not enough to effectively match stories for this task. In this work, we examine a corpus of 5500 stories from distressed teenagers from a major youth social network. We combine Latent Dirichlet Allocation and human interpretation of its output using principles from sociolinguistics to extract high-level themes in the stories and use them to match new stories to similar ones. A user evaluation of the story matching shows that theme-based retrieval does a better job of finding relevant and effective stories for this application than conventional approaches.

Abstract: Temporality and the unfolding of collaborative processes over time are an important aspect in understanding the underlying mechanisms of collaborative learning. In this paper, we describe how interactive sliding window visualizations can integrate with existing methodologies to provide new insight into how interactions develop over time. We illustrate the value of these visualizations by performing a secondary analysis of a corpus analysed in a previous study to show how new insight can be gained and how results at a scale of a whole interactive session can be challenged when looking for time-based irregularities. We conclude by discussing the kinds of insights that can be gained from sliding window visualizations, how they overcome certain methodological limitations of existing techniques for dealing with temporality in CSCL and, in turn, the methodological limitations which they introduce.

Abstract: This paper describes an application of machine translation technology for supporting collaboration in Wikipedia. Wikipedia hosts separate language Wikipedias for hundreds of different languages. While some content is specific to these different versions of Wikipedia, some topics have pages within multiple different Wikipedias. Similarly, while some users participate only in one Wikipedia, we find users who play a bridging role between these sub-communities and participate in the process of maintaining similar pages in different Wikipedias. Since these are not the majority of users, a support tool that allows stretching the effort of these specialized users further by indicating where their effort is needed could be a tremendous benefit to the community. An evaluation of the proposed approach demonstrates promise that such a tool could substantially reduce the effort involved in playing this bridging role on Wikipedia.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel semi-supervised approach for detecting profanity-related offensive content in Twitter. Our approach exploits linguistic regularities in profane language via statistical topic modeling on a huge Twitter corpus, and detects offensive tweets using automatically these generated features. Our approach performs competitively with a variety of machine learning (ML) algorithms. For instance, our approach achieves a true positive rate (TP) of 75.1% over 4029 testing tweets using Logistic Regression, significantly outperforming the popular keyword matching baseline, which has a TP of 69.7%, while keeping the false positive rate (FP) at the same level as the baseline at about 3.77%. Our approach provides an alternative to large scale hand annotation efforts required by fully supervised learning approaches.
- N. Miyake, Sandra Y. Okita, C. Rosé. 2012. Robot Facilitation as Dynamic Support for Collaborative Learning. Abstract: Automated as well as remotely controlled robots have high potential to expand our research and practice in collaborative learning environments. The area of computer supported collaborative learning (CSCL) is one in which advanced technologies have been used effectively to automatically monitor and dynamically structure group discussions for learning. Traditional desktop environments for collaborative learning have included interactions between groups and computer agents with conversational abilities. Robots can take the collaboration out of the computer and into the three dimensional, real world environments of students. This symposium raises the important question of how advanced technologies, such as robotics, may enable us to take the same insights from the area of scripted collaboration and use them to support groups of learners in these environments. Other topic areas include design choices in robotic features that may influence scripted interactions, social behavior, meaningful engagement, and conditions that dynamically support situational factors and generate collaborative learning among students.

Abstract: Adolescent cyber-bullying on social networks is a phenomenon that has received widespread attention. Recent work by sociologists has examined this phenomenon under the larger context of teenage drama and it's manifestations on social networks. Tackling cyber-bullying involves two key components – automatic detection of possible cases, and interaction strategies that encourage reflection and emotional support. Key is showing distressed teenagers that they are not alone in their plight. Conventional topic spotting and document classification into labels like "dating" or "sports" are not enough to effectively match stories for this task. In this work, we examine a corpus of 5500 stories from distressed teenagers from a major youth social network. We combine Latent Dirichlet Allocation and human interpretation of its output using principles from sociolinguistics to extract high-level themes in the stories and use them to match new stories to similar ones. A user evaluation of the story matching shows that theme-based retrieval does a better job of finding relevant and effective stories for this application than conventional approaches.

Abstract: While the study of the connection between discourse patterns and personal identification is decades old, the study of these patterns using language technologies is relatively recent. In that more recent tradition we frame author age prediction from text as a regression problem. We explore the same task using three very different genres of data simultaneously: blogs, telephone conversations, and online forum posts. We employ a technique from domain adaptation that allows us to train a joint model involving all three corpora together as well as separately and analyze differences in predictive features across joint and corpus-specific aspects of the model. Effective features include both stylistic ones (such as POS patterns) as well as content oriented ones. Using a linear regression model based on shallow text features, we obtain correlations up to 0.74 and mean absolute errors between 4.1 and 6.8 years.

Abstract: In this paper we describe a novel feature discovery technique that can be used to model stylistic variation in sociolects. While structural features offer much in terms of expressive power over simpler features used more frequently in machine learning approaches to modeling linguistic variation, they frequently come at an excessive cost in terms of feature space size expansion. We propose a novel form of structural features referred to as "stretchy patterns" that strike a balance between expressive power and compactness in order to enable modeling stylistic variation with reasonably small datasets. As an example we focus on the problem of modeling variation related to gender in personal blogs. Our evaluation demonstrates a significant improvement over standard baselines.
- Iris K. Howley, Elijah Mayfield, C. Rosé. 2011. Missing Something? Authority in Collaborative Learning. Abstract: Past research in individual learning settings has shown that student dispositions such as self-efficacy are predictive of learning and other beneficial outcomes, but the relationship is less clear in a collaborative learning environment. This paper explores authoritativeness of stance within a conversation as a social factor influencing learning and related to self-efficacy in a computer-supported collaborative learning setting. Our results indicate that this authoritativeness measure predicts learning, where selfefficacy does not, and that student and partner authoritativeness predicts group self-efficacy. Further research is required to better determine the relationship between conversational authoritativeness, individual dispositions, and learning.
- Rohit Kumar, C. Rosé. 2011. Comparing Triggering Policies for Social Behaviors. Abstract: Instructional efficacy of automated Conversational Agents designed to help small groups of students achieve higher learning outcomes can be improved by the use of social interaction strategies. These strategies help the tutor agent manage the attention of the students while delivering useful instructional content. Two technical challenges involving the use of social interaction strategies include determining the appropriate policy for triggering these strategies and regulating the amount of social behavior performed by the tutor. In this paper, a comparison of six different triggering policies is presented. We find that a triggering policy learnt from human behavior in combination with a filter that keeps the amount of social behavior comparable to that performed by human tutors offers the most effective solution to the these challenges.
- Rohit Kumar, J. Beuth, C. Rosé. 2011. Conversational Strategies that Support Idea Generation Productivity in Groups. Abstract: Our recent work has shown that conversational tutors that use social interaction strategies can achieve significant learning improvement through better management of student attention. In continuation with this line of investigation, this paper presents an experiment that measures the separate and joint effects of the nature and style of automatically generated interventions. We investigate aspects of designing intervention prompts from two different angles: first in terms of the addition of socially oriented turns over and above the instructional turns required to keep the students on track, and second in terms of the style of presentation of the tutor’s instructional turns. We see positive effects of both manipulations, but on different outcome metrics. Thus, we conclude that the two directions can be productively combined into a single socially enhanced feedback approach, which contributes to the literature on dynamic forms of support for collaborative learning.

Abstract: In this paper we investigate the connection between language and community membership of long time community participants through computational modeling techniques. We report on findings from an analysis of language usage within a popular online discussion forum with participation of thousands of users spanning multiple years. We find community norms of long time participants that are characterized by forum specific jargon and a style that is highly informal and shows familiarity with specific other participants and high emotional involvement in the discussion. We also find quantitative evidence of persistent shifts in language usage towards these norms across users over the course of the first year of community participation. Our observed patterns suggests language stabilization after 8 or 9 months of participation.

Abstract: : Automatic assessment of group processes in collaborative groups is one of the holy grails of the computer supported collaborative learning community. The conversation in collaborative work provides an important window into the inner workings of a group. In this paper we present work towards detecting where students are displaying “reasoning” in conversational speech and how others are building upon those expressions of reasoning (“idea co-construction (ICC)”). Such technology would add to the body of work in educational data mining another means of monitoring student work as well as contributing to the area of automatic collaborative process analysis. We begin by discussing our operationalization of targeted group processes, namely reasoning and ICC. We then discuss the level of success we are able to achieve applying machine learning technology to replicate this human analysis using simple audio signal processing techniques.

Abstract: We present a novel computational formulation of speaker authority in discourse. This notion, which focuses on how speakers position themselves relative to each other in discourse, is first developed into a reliable coding scheme (0.71 agreement between human annotators). We also provide a computational model for automatically annotating text using this coding scheme, using supervised learning enhanced by constraints implemented with Integer Linear Programming. We show that this constrained model's analyses of speaker authority correlates very strongly with expert human judgments (r2 coefficient of 0.947).
- Rohit Kumar, C. Rosé. 2011. Architecture for Building Conversational Agents that Support Collaborative Learning. Abstract: Tutorial Dialog Systems that employ Conversational Agents (CAs) to deliver instructional content to learners in one-on-one tutoring settings have been shown to be effective in multiple learning domains by multiple research groups. Our work focuses on extending this successful learning technology to collaborative learning settings involving two or more learners interacting with one or more agents. Experience from extending existing techniques for developing conversational agents into multiple-learner settings highlights two underlying assumptions from the one-learner setting that do not generalize well to the multiuser setting, and thus cause difficulties. These assumptions include what we refer to as the near-even participation assumption and the known addressee assumption. A new software architecture called Basilica that allows us to address and overcome these limitations is a major contribution of this article. The Basilica architecture adopts an object-oriented approach to represent agents as a network composed of what we refer to as behavioral components because they enable the agents to engage in rich conversational behaviors. Additionally, we describe three specific conversational agents built using Basilica in order to illustrate the desirable properties of this new architecture.
- Elijah Mayfield, Michael Garbus, David Adamson, C. Rosé. 2011. Data-Driven Interaction Patterns: Authority and Information Sharing in Dialogue. Abstract: We explore the utility of a computational framework for social authority in dialogue, codified as utterance-level annotations. We first use these annotations at a macro level, compiling aggregate statistics and showing that the resulting features are predictive of group performance in a task-based dialogue. Then, at a micro level, we introduce the notion of an interaction pattern, a formulation of speaker interactions over multiple turns. We use these patterns to characterize situations where speakers do not share information equally. These patterns are found to be more discriminative at this task than similar patterns using standard dialogue acts.

Abstract: Internet chat-based tutorials are being developed for integrating computer modeling and design and mathematics skills into mechanical engineering undergraduate and middle school outreach programs. In modeling and design projects, tutorials help students navigate complicated software interfaces while teaching fundamental concepts through dynamic dialogues between tutorial agents and student user groups. In a typical assignment, students are asked to perform a design or modeling task that includes the use of software such as a commercial finite element code or specially designed educational software. Students work in teams, but team members are distributed within a room or between remote sites, linked by a text interface. As students collaborate electronically, an intelligent agent monitors their interactions and interjects questions or comments in response to the use of key phrases, or due to other triggers. This platform is also being adapted to the collaborative teaching of mathematics skills in engineering applications. In all projects, agent-monitored tutorials are being used to help automate collaborative learning experiences and to study how students can effectively interact with each other and with the software agents. In undergraduate projects, fundamental knowledge and intuition in interpreting results are emphasized. In outreach efforts, participants are led to consider how their work relates to the broad mechanical engineering profession. Introduction Over the past decade, the landscape in which engineering is practiced has been radically altered by two trends. First, there have been far-reaching technological advances in computing, information-sharing, and automated manufacturing. Second, there have been increasingly strong economic and market pressures for shorter product development cycles and internationally distributed team-based product design and manufacturing. Many of the same technological advances that have transformed engineering practice also have the potential to transform engineering education. For instance, it is widely recognized that guided use of sophisticated simulation software can enable exploratory and inquiry-based modes of learning . If these capabilities are exploited effectively, then integration of simulation-based projects can efficiently increase student learning and understanding. In a related way, internet-based instruction coupled with on-line student collaboration, and the real-time transfer of numerical product designs, numerical simulations, images and product prototypes offers a wide range of possibilities for student learning. Instructors are no longer limited to the use of traditional, on-campus, classroom-based lectures. Recognizing this, we have been engaged in ongoing research both to transform freshman level engineering instruction 10 as well as sophomore level thermodynamics instruction 16, 17, 2, 6 using collaborative project-based learning modules. These modules not only exploit on-line collaboration capabilities, but also employ the use of programmed intelligent software agents, which monitor student interactions and then interject comments and questions designed to teach students directly and/or increase student collaborative learning by teaching each other. Early results have showed improvements in learning of over a letter grade in magnitude for students P ge 22597.2 working with a human partner and a computer agent in comparison with students working alone without the agent. In a series of controlled classroom studies we have continued to improve learning effectiveness through changes in the computer agent design. Important innovations include offering students control over the timing of feedback, using social strategies motivated by the field of collaborative group work , and developing agents that demonstrate alignment with student goals. The underlying thesis of this research is that offering a dynamic self-paced learning environment for student use outside of the lecture room is the best practical means for integrating sophisticated design and analysis experiences into undergraduate engineering curricula. Furthermore, the machine-monitored internet chat-based tutorial environment we use to achieve this goal offers an excellent opportunity for automating and invigorating K-12 outreach efforts and for tying them naturally to more sophisticated undergraduate-level instruction. The foundation of our approach consists of two pillars: 1) self-paced web tutorials guiding students through software use and 2) dynamic, dialogue-based tutorial interfaces which engage students in interpreting simulation results they create. The use of self-paced web tutorials as a means of efficiently integrating complex software package use into undergraduate curricula has been the subject of a long-term effort at Carnegie Mellon . The integration of an agentmonitored dialogue-based interface into software instruction represents a substantial enhancement to this approach. As we deploy dialogue-based tutorials, we are not simply using them to enhance software instruction. We are also studying how students learn and teach each other in a tutorial-guided dynamic chat environment involving students in one or multiple groups. Our initial focus has been a first-year introductory and second-year thermodynamics mechanical engineering courses; however, our goal is to establish a template for a new approach to design and analysis instruction throughout our curriculum. Furthermore, we are also applying our agent-monitored dialoguebased tutorial platform to the task of middle school student outreach. Tutor Architecture and Interface In this research, we are adapting a prototype architecture we have developed for supporting student interactions in a broad range of activities . This unique, automated, collaborative learning platform naturally exploits chat room-style communications that are ubiquitous on the internet, and also students’ comfort and curiosity with that environment. In our prior work using a similar environment for middle school math instruction, students found the collaborative problem solving environment highly engaging. Some students commented that the collaborative environment was “way more fun” than their typical computer lab activities, and that they were disappointed when the 45 minutes lab session was over. The idea behind its design is for a filter to process the text from an ongoing discussion as it is happening, and to build an internal model of how the conversation is progressing. Using this model, it is possible to determine where the most strategic opportunities for supporting learning exist. Figure 1 shows an overview of the architecture used to develop our prototype infrastructure. This architecture is meant to allow context-sensitive support for collaborative learning and reflection not only to be triggered based on what is happening in the discussion, but P ge 22597.3 Conversational Agents e.g. TuTalk Participants (Students) Filters Event Notifications Internal Triggers e.g. Topic Shift External Triggers e.g. Timer Knowledge Sources e.g. Recipes Communications for it to do so with awareness of how it is affecting the state of the conversation through its continuous monitoring. Thus, if an intervention is triggered erroneously and ends up having a negative effect on the collaboration, we can detect and correct that. In this way, we minimize the risk of misdiagnosing the state of the collaboration. As displayed in Figure 1, all interface events resulting from student contributions to the chat interface and to a shared problem solving or simulation space are sent to the Filters module. Its purpose is to identify significant events in this stream that it then reflects back to the interfaces of the students. It also uses these identified events to update its internal state. Other triggers such as timers that keep track of time elapsed since the beginning of the session or since the last significant contribution of each student are also used to manipulate the Filter module’s internal state. The internal state then is used to select strategies for selecting dialogue agents to participate in the chat session in order to offer support in the form of interactive directed lines of reasoning. In our prior experiments we have used different kinds of triggers including topic-based filters, time-outs, interface actions, and conversational actions that are indicative of the degree of engagement of the students in the discussion. Our generic architecture is meant to be easily extended to work with other types of triggers such as cues from other modalities like speech, hand sketches, etc. We continue to improve the architecture to provide richer communication and modularization. Conversational agents meant to offer support in the midst of collaborative learning interactions can be authored with the TuTalk dialogue agent authoring system . As displayed in Figure 1, when the Filters module sends a notification to the Conversational Agents module to trigger a particular cognitive support agent, the scheduled TuTalk agent is appended to a queue of TuTalk Agents, which are then launched in turn at appropriate breaks in problem solving behavior.

Abstract: In this demo, we present SciSumm, an interactive multi-document summarization system for scientific articles. The document collection to be summarized is a list of papers cited together within the same source article, otherwise known as a co-citation. At the heart of the approach is a topic based clustering of fragments extracted from each article based on queries generated from the context surrounding the co-cited list of papers. This analysis enables the generation of an overview of common themes from the co-cited papers that relate to the context in which the co-citation was found. SciSumm is currently built over the 2008 ACL Anthology, however the generalizable nature of the summarization techniques and the extensible architecture makes it possible to use the system with other corpora where a citation network is available. Evaluation results on the same corpus demonstrate that our system performs better than an existing widely used multi-document summarization system (MEAD).

Typically, phish detection methods either use human-verified URL blacklists or exploit Web page features via machine learning techniques. However, the former is frail in terms of new phish, and the latter suffers from the scarcity of effective features and the high false positive rate (FP). To alleviate those problems, we propose a layered anti-phishing solution that aims at (1) exploiting the expressiveness of a rich set of features with machine learning to achieve a high true positive rate (TP) on novel phish, and (2) limiting the FP to a low level via filtering algorithms.
 Specifically, we proposed CANTINA+, the most comprehensive feature-based approach in the literature including eight novel features, which exploits the HTML Document Object Model (DOM), search engines and third party services with machine learning techniques to detect phish. Moreover, we designed two filters to help reduce FP and achieve runtime speedup. The first is a near-duplicate phish detector that uses hashing to catch highly similar phish. The second is a login form filter, which directly classifies Web pages with no identified login form as legitimate.
 We extensively evaluated CANTINA+ with two methods on a diverse spectrum of corpora with 8118 phish and 4883 legitimate Web pages. In the randomized evaluation, CANTINA+ achieved over 92% TP on unique testing phish and over 99% TP on near-duplicate testing phish, and about 0.4% FP with 10% training phish. In the time-based evaluation, CANTINA+ also achieved over 92% TP on unique testing phish, over 99% TP on near-duplicate testing phish, and about 1.4% FP under 20% training phish with a two-week sliding window. Capable of achieving 0.4% FP and over 92% TP, our CANTINA+ has been demonstrated to be a competitive anti-phishing solution.

Abstract: We present a novel unsupervised approach to the problem of multi-document summarization of scientific articles, in which the document collection is a list of papers cited together within the same source article, otherwise known as a co-citation. At the heart of the approach is a topic based clustering of fragments extracted from each co-cited article and relevance ranking using a query generated from the context surrounding the co-cited list of papers. This analysis enables the generation of an overview of common themes from the co-cited papers that relate to the context in which the co-citation was found. We present a system called SciSumm that embodies this approach and apply it to the 2008 ACL Anthology. We evaluate this summarization system for relevant content selection using gold standard summaries prepared on principle based guidelines. Evaluation with gold standard summaries demonstrates that our system performs better in content selection than an existing summarization system (MEAD). We present a detailed summary of our findings and discuss possible directions for future research.
- Sharad V. Oberoi, Dong Nguyen, S. Finger, C. Rosé. 2010. Automatic Extraction of Conceptual Maps From Design Team Documents. Abstract: Most engineering project classes expect teams of students to collaborate and to build on existing knowledge to accomplish their project goals. As the project evolves, the team is expected to develop a shared understanding. However, students often become overwhelmed by the amount of information available and lose sight of the big picture. Instructors may also find it difficult to keep track of individual and team activities and are often forced to evaluate the product instead of the learning process. This paper presents preliminary results from a tool that supports effective knowledge management for engineering design projects. This framework, called DesignWebs, automatically extracts conceptual maps from the team’s evolving set of documents and discussions about an engineering artifact. It uses Latent Dirichlet Allocation, hierarchical clustering, and other machine learning techniques to generate a navigable web-based graph. Both instructors and students can browse this graph interactively to explore the concepts embedded inside design team documents and the connections between them. An experiment performed on documents obtained from a project course shows the effectiveness of DesignWebs in synthesizing the design knowledge from multiple sources of information in engineering project teams.Copyright © 2010 by ASME

Abstract: In this paper we investigate how to identify initiation-response pairs in asynchronous, multi-threaded, multi-party conversations. We formulate the task of identifying initiation-response pairs as a pairwise ranking problem. A novel variant of Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA) is proposed to overcome a limitation of standard LSA models, namely that uncommon words, which are critical for signaling initiation-response links, tend to be deemphasized as it is the more frequent terms that end up closer to the latent factors selected through singular value decomposition. We present experimental results demonstrating significantly better performance of the novel variant of LSA over standard LSA.

Abstract: The identification of optimal candidates for ventricular assist device (VAD) therapy is of great importance for future widespread application of this life-saving technology. During recent years, numerous traditional statistical models have been developed for this task. In this study, we compared three different supervised machine learning techniques for risk prognosis of patients on VAD: Decision Tree, Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Bayesian Tree-Augmented Network, to facilitate the candidate identification. A predictive (C4.5) decision tree model was ultimately developed based on 6 features identified by SVM with assistance of recursive feature elimination. This model performed better compared to the popular risk score of Lietz et al. with respect to identification of high-risk patients and earlier survival differentiation between high- and low-risk candidates.
- Rohit Kumar, C. Rosé. 2010. Conversational Tutors with Rich Interactive Behaviors that support Collaborative Learning. Abstract: In addition to presenting relevant instructional content to learners in collaborative learning settings, intelligent conversational tutors must be good communicators to keep the students attentive and engaged. In our recent work, we have shown that tutors capable of performing both task-related (tutoring) as well as social behavior are more effective tutors than tutors that perform only task-related behavior. It is also important to consider that collaborative learning tasks in ill-defined domains (like engineering design) require students to negotiate among competing goals. Thus, automated tutors must be capable of supporting students with different roles and potentially competing goals. In this paper, we will describe the most recent implementation of the CycleTalk tutor using the Basilica architecture that demonstrates these social behavior and role supporting capabilities. Also, we briefly discuss results of an experiment using this tutor that optimizes the amount of social behavior in such learning settings.

Abstract: Conversational Agents have been shown to be effective tutors in a wide range of educational domains. However, these agents are often ignored and abused in collaborative learning scenarios involving multiple students. In our work presented here, we design and evaluate interaction strategies motivated from prior research in small group communication. We will discuss how such strategies can be implemented in agents. As a first step towards evaluating agents that can interact socially, we report results showing that human tutors employing these strategies are able to cover more concepts with the students besides being rated as better integrated, likeable and friendlier.

Automatic assessment of student “reasoning” processes in face-to-face interactions using speech data. Abstract: Assessment of student reasoning processes is one of the holy grails of intelligent tutoring. One way in which students display their reasoning is through conversation. In this paper we present work towards detecting where students are displaying “reasoning” in conversational speech. Such technology would add to the body of work in educational data mining another means of monitoring student work. Because the concept of reasoning is somewhat abstract, we first discuss how we have operationalized it, achieving an agreement of 0.67 kappa between human raters. We then discuss how we have used machine learning technology to predict whether a given speech segment contains a reasoning statement using features that can be extracted automatically using simple audio signal processing techniques. The result is promising with an f-score of 0.63.

Abstract: In this work, we propose a novel representation of text based on patterns derived from linguistic annotation graphs. We use a subgraph mining algorithm to automatically derive features as frequent subgraphs from the annotation graph. This process generates a very large number of features, many of which are highly correlated. We propose a genetic programming based approach to feature construction which creates a fixed number of strong classification predictors from these subgraphs. We evaluate the benefit gained from evolved structured features, when used in addition to the bag-of-words features, for a sentiment classification task.
- G. Stahl, C. Rosé, S. Goggins. 2010. ANALYZING THE DISCOURSE OF GEOGEBRA COLLABORATIONS. Abstract: This is a position paper presenting a perspective on fundamental assumptions about doing, teaching and learning mathematics in the presence of computer and communicative technologies. Doing, teaching and learning mathematics are activities that centrally involve discourse. Computer and communication technologies can facilitate collaborative interactions around mathematical topics. This can make the processes of doing, teaching and learning mathematics visible to researchers in the traces of small-group interaction. Analysis of the discourse can reveal processes of mathematical group cognition. We argue for a view of mathematics as discourse and for a specific set of complementary approaches to analyzing collaborative math discourse.
- G. Stahl, C. Rosé. 2010. Group Cognition in Online Teams. Abstract: This chapter represents a disciplinary perspective from Computer-Supported Collaborative Learning (CSCL), an interdisciplinary field concerned with leveraging technology for education and with analyzing cognitive processes like learning and meaning making in small groups of students (Stahl, Koschmann & Suthers, 2006). Group cognition is a theory developed to support CSCL research by describing how collaborative groups of students could achieve cognitive accomplishments together and how that could benefit the individual learning of the participants (Stahl, 2006). It is important to note that while it may very well be the case that a group of students working together manage to solve problems faster than any of them may have been able to do alone, the most important benefits to group cognition are the potential for genuinely innovative solutions that go beyond the expertise of any individual in the group, the deeper understanding that is achieved through the interaction as part of that creative process, and the lasting impact of that deep understanding that the students take with them when they move on from that interaction, which they may then carry with them as new resources into subsequent group problem-solving scenarios. Group cognition can then be seen as what transforms groups into factories for the creation of new knowledge. The types of problems that have been the focus of exploration within the group cognition paradigm have thus not been routine, well-structured problems where every participant can know exactly what their piece of the puzzle is up front in such a way that the team can function as a well oiled machine. Many critical group tasks do not fit into well-known and practiced protocols—for example, low-resource circumstances that may occur in disaster situations, where standard solutions are not an option. In acknowledgement of this, the focus within the group-cognition research has been on problems that offer groups the opportunity to explore creatively how those problems can be approached from a variety of perspectives, where the groups are encouraged to explore unique perspectives. The processes that are the concern of group-cognition research have not primarily been those that are related to efficiency of problem solving (as in some other chapters of this volume). Rather, the focus has been on the pivotal moments where a creative spark or a process of collaborative knowledge building occurs through interaction. Our fascination has been with identifying the conditions under which these moments of inspiration are triggered, with the goal …

Abstract: Automatic analysis of discussion logs from studies of computer supported collaborative learning has become more prevalent as technology for machine learning and text mining have become more powerful and usable. We extend this effort to analysis of transcripts of whole group classroom discussions. We argue in favor of adapting a transactivity based framework developed for analysis of collaborative learning discussions for use in the context of whole class discussions. Results from an evaluation of this technology applied to transcripts from 3 class periods of middle school math demonstrate promising results, specifically Cohen's Kappa of .69 in comparison with human annotators for identifying transactive contributions and .68 for identifying which prior utterance a transactive contribution relates to. Potential applications for teacher professional development, automatic assessment of learning processes, and real time support for classroom discussion facilitators is discussed. Implications for theory building related to learning in classroom discussions is also addressed.
- Elijah Mayfield, C. Rosé. 2010. Using feature construction to avoid large feature spaces in text classification. Abstract: Feature space design is a critical part of machine learning. This is an especially difficult challenge in the field of text classification, where an arbitrary number of features of varying complexity can be extracted from documents as a preprocessing step. A challenge for researchers has consistently been to balance expressiveness of features with the size of the corresponding feature space, due to issues with data sparsity that arise as feature spaces grow larger. Drawing on past successes utilizing genetic programming in similar problems outside of text classification, we propose and implement a technique for constructing complex features from simpler features, and adding these more complex features into a combined feature space which can then be utilized by more sophisticated machine learning classifiers. Applying this technique to a sentiment analysis problem, we show encouraging improvement in classification accuracy, with a small and constant increase in feature space size. We also show that the features we generate carry far more predictive power than any of the simple features they contain.

Abstract: Internet chat-based tutorials are being developed for integrating computer modeling and design skills into mechanical engineering undergraduate and middle school outreach programs. These tutorials help students navigate complicated software interfaces while teaching fundamental concepts through dynamic dialogues between tutorial agents and student user groups. In a typical assignment, students are asked to perform a design or modeling task that includes the use of software such as a commercial finite element code or specially designed educational software. Students work in teams, but team members are distributed within a room or between remote sites, linked by a text interface. As students collaborate electronically, an intelligent agent monitors their interactions and interjects questions or comments in response to the use of key phrases, or due to other triggers. This platform is being used to help automate collaborative learning experiences and to study how students can effectively interact with each other and with the software agents. In undergraduate projects, fundamental technical skills and intuition in interpreting results are emphasized. In outreach efforts, participants are led to consider how their work relates to the broad mechanical engineering profession.
- G. Stahl, C. Rosé, A. Powell. 2010. SUPPORTING GROUP MATH COGNITION IN VIRTUAL MATH TEAMS WITH SOFTWARE CONVERSATIONAL AGENTS. Abstract: This is a research paper on a new tool to support dynamic mathematics in education. The research explores the use of software agents to engage in synchronous interaction with a small group of students working online in the Virtual Math Teams environment. The purpose of the agents is to facilitate discourse by the students that promotes their collaborative learning. In particular, the conversational agents try to encourage academically productive talk, in which students work together in ways that are accountable to each other and to their task. The agents are currently being tested in student groups working on problems in combinatorics. This research will soon be extended to student groups using a multi-user version of GeoGebra.

Abstract: In this paper we investigate the effect of the context of interaction on the extent to which a contributor's perspective bias is displayed through their lexical choice. We present a series of experiments on political discussion data. Our experiments indicate that (i) when people quote contributors with an opposing view, they tend to quote the words that are less strongly associated with the opposing view. (ii) Nevertheless, in quoting their opponents, the displayed bias of their word distributions shifts towards that of their opponents. (iii) The personal bias of the speaker is displayed most clearly through the words that are not quoted, (iv) although characteristics of the quoted message do have a measurable effect on the words that are included in the contribution. And, finally, (v) posts are influenced by the displayed bias of previous posts in a thread.
- Rohit Kumar, H. Ai, C. Rosé. 2010. Choosing Optimal Levels of Social Interaction-Towards creating Human-like Conversational Tutors. Abstract: Recent results show that socially-capable conversational tutors can be effective support in collaborative learning situations. However, in comparison to human-level social capability, we find scope for improving the tutors both in connection with learning (performance) as well as liking (perception). In this paper, we describe work towards improving state-of-the-art conversational tutors by shrinking the gap between automated and human-level social capabilities. An experiment that explores the effect of amount of social behavior is described. Besides confirming the learning effects of sociallycapable tutors from a previous study, we report on the optimal levels of social and task interaction to improve learner performance.

Workshop on Opportunities for intelligent and adaptive behavior in collaborative learning systems. Abstract: One unique characteristic of learning systems that support peer collaboration is that these systems have the potential to supplement or replace softwarebased representations of domainand learner-models with the representations implicitly formed by peers. In order to realize this potential, a collaborative activity must sufficiently motivate peers to reflect, collect, and communicate these mental models. Peer-assessment represents a class of activities that address this challenge by design. In this work, we describe a project, currently under development, in which peer-assessment is melded with peer-instruction to create a new learning activity for an existing collaborative learning platform. We present the rationale behind the design of the activity, focusing specifically on how it draws from and synthesizes the three modes of learning supported by the Grockit platform: adaptive individual study, live collaborative small-group study, and instructor-led skill-focused lessons. By treating teaching as a demonstration of learning, we illustrate how a single activity can peer-assess mastery and peer-assist learning.

Abstract: We present an empirical investigation of the annotation cost estimation task for active learning in a multi-annotator environment. We present our analysis from two perspectives: selecting examples to be presented to the user for annotation; and evaluating selective sampling strategies when actual annotation cost is not available. We present our results on a movie review classification task with rationale annotations. We demonstrate that a combination of instance, annotator and annotation task characteristics are important for developing an accurate estimator, and argue that both correlation coefficient and root mean square error should be used for evaluating annotation cost estimators.

Abstract: This paper presents a model which can automatically detect a variety o f student speech acts as students collaborate within a computer supported collaborative learning environment. In addition, an analysis is presented which gives substantial insight as to how students' learning is associated with students' speech acts, knowledge that will significantly influence how this model is utilized by running learning software. Within Piagetian theory, the cognitive conflict of ideas between students is seen as beneficial for learning. Which sorts of interpersonal behaviors lead to most effective learning, however, is open to debate, with some researchers arguing that cooperation is most effective and others arguing that interpersonal conflict is a natural part of collaborative learning. We find that, in fact, interpersonal conflict is associated with positive learning, a finding that must be taken into account, in designing interventions that rely upon detectors of students' speech acts in CSCL environments.

Abstract: While human-computer interaction (HCI) methodologies are designed to be general, they have most often been applied in the context of literate end users in the West. These methodologies may, however, need rethinking for application in HCI for the developing world (HCID) contexts, where many of the basic assumptions that underpin the methods may not always hold true. In this article, we present an overview of one factor that is significantly different in the HCID context—the literacy of the end user—by drawing on the literature of orality, and we offer a framework for HCID methodology that we argue is more appropriate for the HCID context. Based on this framework, we then present guidelines for design and user research methodologies in such contexts, highlighting seminal HCID research that corroborates these guidelines.

Abstract: This paper presents an analysis of a small user study investigating difficulties rural Indian users have with search technology in the context of an Information Technology course. We present a qualitative analysis of the result write-up of the information-seeking task along with a log analysis of their corresponding search behavior. The goal of the analysis is to identify difficulties such users have with information seeking tasks so that appropriate support can be designed for them. Specific difficulties identified in the qualitative analysis indicate that students tend to simply ignore material they have trouble understanding, which leads to varying negative consequences. Our analysis demonstrates that we can extract predictors from logs of student search behavior that helps us identify where these students are having difficulty during the search task.

Abstract: Project course instructors routinely perform their formal assessments based on impressions formed from their mostly indirect experience with the groups they oversee. Nevertheless, even with their limited vantage point, instructors trust their ability to make assessments and regulate group work. In this paper we present a 5 dimensional assessment framework based on data from an interview study in which we investigate the assessment goals that project course instructors have. We use this framework to identify specifically where instructors' assessments about students diverge most from that of direct observers of group work. We then demonstrate that indicators extracted automatically from recorded speech from group meetings frequently correlate better with objective observer rating of students than that of the instructor.

Abstract: We present the results of a study in which we contrast alternative forms of collaborative learning support in the midst of a collaborative design task in which students negotiate between increasing power and increasing environmental friendliness. Our research question is whether interactive instructional support in collaborative learning environments is more effective when it is offered as solicited or unsolicited help. The finding from our classroom study is that dialogue-based support is more effective in this collaborative context when invitations for help in the form of pointer hints are offered automatically, but dialogue agents are only provided when the invitation is explicitly accepted.

We argue that this distinction is important based on a study of customer behavior in making purchasing decisions using online reviews. We present results of a supervised algorithm for learning this distinction. The two types of claims are expressed differently in language and we show that syntactic features capture this difference, yielding improvement over a bag-of-words baseline.

Abstract: This paper presents a user study based log analysis of the search behavior of low-literacy users in the developing world. It is first step towards Web search personalization for such users, which has been hindered by a paucity of appropriate data for inducing effective user models that target the real problems in information access for low literacy user population. We demonstrate the variations in the behavior of such users with the ‘typical’ user population by comparing the user actions during an Information Seeking session. The users deviated from the ‘ideal’ search behavior during the course of the information-seeking session with inefficient use of querying and subsequent navigation of the search results. We present an analysis that offers intuitions for more efficient information seeking practices for such users.

Abstract: The motivating effects of collaborative learning have long been argued, however a careful analysis of the relationship between the motivation orientation of a student and perceptions of himself, his partners, his collaborative behaviors, and learning in a collaborative context have not been as thoroughly explored. In this paper we present an exploratory analysis of data from a collaborative learning study from the standpoint of motivation type of students and their partners. Overall, what we see is that a student's own motivation orientation may color their perception of the exchange of help in the collaboration, sometimes obscuring the reality of the help actually exchanged.
- Naman K. Gupta, C. Rosé. 2009. A foray into Understanding the Next Billion Search Users. Abstract: This paper presents an investigation into the search behavior of low literacy users in the developing world, like the participants from rural areas in India for our study. The field of personalization research has been hindered by a paucity of appropriate data for inducing effective user models that target the real problems in information access for needy populations, such as low literacy users. Our goal is to address these limitations using a data-driven, user centered methodology. We present results from an experimental study that demonstrates that some important assumptions underlying current probabilistic models of information seeking on the web that govern the behavior of popular search services such as Google and Yahoo are not valid for our target user population. We present an analysis that offers specific suggestions for better supporting the information seeking practices of such users. Author Keywords

Experiments comparing our approach with several other approaches that generalize dependency features or ngrams demonstrate the utility of composite back-off features.

Gweon, Yi-Chia Wang, Mahesh Joshi. 2008. New challenges in CSCL: towards adaptive script support. Abstract: Scaffolding learners, i.e. helping learners to attain tasks they could not accomplish without support, entails the notion of fading, i.e. reducing the scaffolding for learners to become more and more self-regulated. Fading implies to tailor support for collaboration, such as collaboration scripts, to the particular needs of the specific collaborators. In computer supported collaborative learning (CSCL) settings, support can be designed in a very restrictive and inflexible fashion; at the same time computerized settings open new possibilities for the realization of adaptive support as they enable automation of analysis and feedback mechanisms. In this symposium we present new technical approaches and latest empirical research on possibilities and limitations of adaptive support for learners in CSCL settings.

Abstract: In this type-II demo, we introduce SIDE (the Summarization Integrated Development Environment), an infrastructure that facilitates construction of summaries tailored to the needs of the user. It aims to address the issue that there is no such thing as the perfect summary for all purposes. Rather, the quality of a summary is subjective, task dependent, and possibly specific to a user. The SIDE framework allows users flexibility in determining what they find more useful in a summary, both in terms of structure and content. As an educational tool, it has been successfully user tested by a class of 21 students in a graduate course on Summarization and Personal Information Management.

Abstract: We investigate how the affordances provided by alternative interfaces for on-line discussion forums affect the structure of the discourse that unfolds. In order to investigate this impact, we compare the predictive power of time related and text similarity related features for identifying parent-child links between messages. The results from this work using this methodology suggest that interfaces that make parent-child relationships between messages explicit and do not constrain the choice of previous messages that users can reply to allow patterns of conversational behavior that violate the assumptions of traditional, tree-structured models of discourse where time related and similarity related features are highly predictive. An implication for future work is that because there is evidence that interface affordances affect the form of conversational contributions, techniques that process on-line communication data may need to be adapted for different communication interfaces.

Our analysis suggests that although environments like LegSim offer great potential for providing students with valuable opportunities to develop important skills, active support during participation is needed to ensure that students take these opportunities when they are presented (1).

Abstract: Students are starting to use networked visual argumentation tools to discuss, debate, and argue with one another about topics presented by a teacher. However, this development gives rise to an emergent issue for teachers: how do they support students during these e-discussions? The ARGUNAUT system aims to provide the teacher (or moderator) with tools that will facilitate effective moderation of several simultaneous e-discussions. Awareness Indicators, provided as part of a moderator's user interface, help monitor the progress of discussions on several dimensions (e.g., critical reasoning). In this paper we discuss preliminary steps taken in using machine learning techniques to support the Awareness Indicators. Focusing on individual contributions (single objects containing textual content, contributed in the visual workspace by students) and sequences of two linked contributions (two objects, the connection between them, and the students' textual contributions), we have run a series of machine learning experiments in an attempt to train classifiers to recognize important student actions, such as using critical reasoning and raising and answering questions. The initial results presented in this paper are encouraging, but we are only at the beginning of our analysis.
- Darren Gergle, C. Rosé, R. Kraut. 2007. Modeling the impact of shared visual information on collaborative reference. Abstract: A number of recent studies have demonstrated that groups benefit considerably from access to shared visual information. This is due, in part, to the communicative efficiencies provided by the shared visual context. However, a large gap exists between our current theoretical understanding and our existing models. We address this gap by developing a computational model that integrates linguistic cues with visual cues in a way that effectively models reference during tightly-coupled, task-oriented interactions. The results demonstrate that an integrated model significantly outperforms existing language-only and visual-only models. The findings can be used to inform and augment the development of conversational agents, applications that dynamically track discourse and collaborative interactions, and dialogue managers for natural language interfaces.

Abstract: We evaluate a new hybrid language processing approach designed for interactive applications that maintain an interaction with users over multiple turns. Specifically, we describe a method for using a simple topic hierarchy in combination with a standard information retrieval measure of semantic similarity to reason about the selection of appropriate feedback in response to extended language inputs in the context of an interactive tutorial system designed to support creative problem solving. Our evaluation demonstrates the value of using a machine learning approach that takes feedback from experts into account for optimizing the hierarchy based feedback selection strategy.

Abstract: In this paper we investigate the role of reflection in simulation based learning by manipulating two independent factors that each separately lead to significant learning effects, namely whether students worked alone or in pairs, and what type of support students were provided with. Our finding is that in our simulation based learning task, students learned significantly more when they worked in pairs than when they worked alone. Furthermore, dynamic support implemented with tutorial dialogue agents lead to significantly more learning than no support, while static support was not statistically distinguishable from either of the other two conditions. The largest effect size in comparison with the control condition of individuals working alone with no support was Pairs+Dynamic support, with an effect size of 1.24 standard deviations.

Abstract: We report our experiments towards improving an existing publicly available Indian English voice using additional data. The additional data was used to create new duration and pronunciation models as well as to convert the existing voice to create a more Indian sounding voice. Two experiments along the above lines are reported. In the first experiment, we found that changing the pronunciation models has the potential to improve an existing Indian English voice. We conducted a second experiment to validate this finding. The second experiment shows the potential value in carefully investigating the separate effects of the different components of a pronunciation model in order to understand their unique contributions to improving an Indian English voice.

Abstract: It is often assumed that engaging in a one-on-one dialogue with a tutor is more effective than listening to a lecture or reading a text. Although earlier experiments have not always supported this hypothesis, this may be due in part to allowing the tutors to cover different content than the noninteractive instruction. In 7 experiments, we tested the interaction hypothesis under the constraint that (a) all students covered the same content during instruction, (b) the task domain was qualitative physics, (c) the instruction was in natural language as opposed to mathematical or other formal languages, and (d) the instruction conformed with a widely observed pattern in human tutoring: Graesser, Person, and Magliano's 5-step frame. In the experiments, we compared 2 kinds of human tutoring (spoken and computer mediated) with 2 kinds of natural-language-based computer tutoring (Why2-Atlas and Why2-AutoTutor) and 3 control conditions that involved studying texts. The results depended on whether the students' preparation matched the content of the instruction. When novices (students who had not taken college physics) studied content that was written for intermediates (students who had taken college physics), then tutorial dialogue was reliably more beneficial than less interactive instruction, with large effect sizes. When novices studied material written for novices or intermediates studied material written for intermediates, then tutorial dialogue was not reliably more effective than the text-based control conditions.

Abstract: In this paper, we describe an environment for supporting collaborative problem solving that uses dialogue agents both for creating a collaborative attitude between students as well as for offering instruction. We evaluated the effect of the social dialogue agents on student collaboration by contrasting a condition that included the social agents with a condition that did not include them. Both conditions involved dialogue agents for offering math instruction. Our finding is that the social agents changed the attitude students displayed towards one another as well as their perceptions of how much help they gave a received. There was some weak evidence suggestive of a positive learning effect. Index Terms: tutorial dialogue, computer supported collaborative learning

Abstract: In this paper, we explore the effect of the form of feedback offered by a computer supported collaborative learning (CSCL) environment on the roles that students see themselves as taking and that their behavior reflects. We do this by experimentally contrasting collaboration in two feedback configurations, one which is identical to the state-of-the-art in intelligent tutoring technology (Immediate Feedback), and one which is based on a long line of investigation of the use of worked out examples for instruction (Delayed Feedback). While our conclusions remain tentative due to the small sample size, the data reveal a consistent gender by condition interaction pattern across questionnaire, test, and discourse data in which male students prefer and benefit more from collaboration in the Immediate Feedback condition where they are more likely to take on the role of a help provider rather than a help receiver while the patterns is the opposite for females.
- Hao-Chuan Wang, C. Rosé. 2007. A Process Analysis of Idea Generation and Failure. Abstract: A Process Analysis of Idea Generation and Failure Hao-Chuan Wang and Carolyn Penstein Rose (haochuan,cprose@cs.cmu.edu) Language Technologies Institute, Carnegie Mellon University 5000 Forbes Avenue, Pittsburgh, PA 15213 USA Abstract This paper presents an experimental study and detailed process analysis investigating the temporal characteristics of idea generation and idea failure during brainstorming. In this investigation, we test the hypothesis that cognitive interference resulting from group interactions has a temporary effect and thus decays as the rate of unique idea generation decays. A further hypothesis is that the effects of cognitive stimulation from external stimuli become more evident over time as the effects of cognitive interference decay. Both of these hypotheses are confirmed by our process analysis. Keywords: Cognitive stimulation; cognitive interference. Introduction The task of idea generation in brainstorming groups has been extensively studied through controlled experiments (Diehl & Stroebe, 1987) and simulation studies (Nijstad & Stroebe, 2006). In the study of group brainstorming for idea generation, empirical work has repeatedly revealed evidence of process losses, in which a group with idea sharing may not always perform better than a collection of non- interacting individuals whose contributions are simply pooled afterwards (i.e., nominal groups), both in terms of the quantity and quality of unique ideas (Hill, 1982; Diehl & Stroebe). A wide range of social and cognitive explanations for process losses have been proposed and evaluated, including social pressure (e.g., evaluation apprehension), social loafing (e.g., “free riding”), production blocking resulting from turn taking conventions (Diehl & Stroebe), and cognitive interference from exposure to similar ideas to the current idea generation focus (Nijstad & Stroebe). One influential explanation for process losses in group idea generation grows out of the theory of cognitive stimulation and cognitive interference, which models idea generation by individuals as a memory retrieval process (Dugosh, Paulus, Roland & Yang, 2000; Nijstad & Stroebe, 2006). Idea failure related to cognitive interference occurs when one fails to retrieve an image from memory, retrieves an image but fails to generate an idea from it, repeatedly activates the same images, or generates ideas that have already been mentioned. When brainstorming in groups, ideas verbalized by peers may serve as external stimulation potentially leading to one of two extreme results, either process gains or process losses. In the first case, overhearing a peer’s ideas may serve as cognitive stimulation for memory retrieval and idea generation when those ideas are significantly different from what an individual was capable of generating alone, while in the later case, this external stimulation becomes a source of cognitive interference leading to process losses. This may occur because the same domain knowledge continues to be activated, which facilitates the generation of similar ideas to those mentioned recently. In cases such as these, brainstorming individuals may believe they have exhausted the number of ideas they are able to generate (Nijstad & Stroebe). The temporal properties of priming and cognitive stimulation have been investigated (Raaijmakers & Shiffrin, 1981), but a similar investigation of the temporal properties of cognitive interference have not been investigated. Rather, the effects of cognitive interference and related process losses have primarily been evaluated summatively. In order to investigate the temporal properties of cognitive interference and resulting process losses, we present in this paper an experimental study and detailed process analysis. In the remainder of the paper we discuss the theoretical model of idea generation that underlies this work, our experimental study, and findings from our process analysis. Theoretical Model Brainstorming may be modeled from a cognitive perspective as a two stage process in which a search is initiated in response to a challenge presented during the first stage, and then an idea is constructed during this search by means of inferences building upon prior knowledge (Nijstad & Stroebe, 2006). Psychological studies in spreading activation have demonstrated that it is more efficient to retrieve a concept from memory when relevant information is offered as a prime or cue (Anderson, 2005). Based on the cognitive theory of associative memory (Anderson; Brown & Paulus, 2002; Dugosh et al., 2000), idea generation can be viewed as a process of building on the retrieval of information encoded in the stimulated portions of a semantic network stored in one’s long-term memory. The process of generating a new idea is said to involve a constructive process analogous to that of self-explanation (Chi, De Leeuw, Chiu & Lavancher, 1994) in which bridging inferences link instances of known domain facts on the way towards generating ideas (Brown & Paulus, 2002). For example, someone may have access to the following two domain facts: (1) Debris flow refers to the mass movement of rocks and sedimentary materials in a fluid like manner. And, (2) There are many typhoons, or hurricanes, in Taiwan in the summer time. That person may then make the following two bridging inferences: (1) Heavy rain implies the presence of a massive amount of water. And, (2) The presence of a massive amount of water may lead to erosion or the movement of rocks in a fluid like manner. That person may then generate the following idea: “Typhoons may be a factor leading to the occurrence of a debris flow hazard.” It is the middle stage, where bridging

Abstract: Problem difficulty estimates play important roles in a wide variety of educational systems, including determining the sequence of problems presented to students and the interpretation of the resulting responses. The accuracy of these metrics are therefore important, as they can determine the relevance of an educational experience. For systems that record large quantities of raw data, these observations can be used to test the predictive accuracy of an existing difficulty metric. In this paper, we examine how well one rigorously developed – but potentially outdated – difficulty scale for American-English spelling fits the data collected from seventeen thousand students using our SpellBEE peer-tutoring system. We then attempt to construct alternate metrics that use collected data to achieve a better fit. The domain-independent techniques presented here are applicable when the matrix of available student-response data is sparsely populated or non-randomly sampled. We find that while the original metric fits the data relatively well, the datadriven metrics provide approximately 10% improvement in predictive accuracy. Using these techniques, a difficulty metric can be periodically or continuously recalibrated to ensure the relevance of the educational experience for the student.
- C. Rosé, F. Fischer, Chun-Yen Chang. 2007. Exploring the influence of culture on collaborative learning. Abstract: As on-line learning becomes more ubiquitous, and multi-ethnic on-line classrooms become more commonplace, it becomes more crucial to explore cultural communication issues and how we can design on-line learning environments that can facilitate productive learning experiences under these conditions. Our short term research focus is to develop automatic on-line assessment technologies and adaptive support technologies as infrastructure for supporting and studying collaborative learning in multiple cultures. The specific objective of our international collaboration has been to explore the intersection between the technology research area of text classification and the behavioral research area of collaborative learning process analysis. Beyond simply being an application of existing technology to a well defined framework for discourse analysis, this collaboration has yielded interesting new technical challenges and findings (Donmez et al., 2005; Rosé et al., 2005; Stegmann et al., 2006; Wang et al., 2007; Wang et al., submitted), questions about behavioral research methodology (Gweon et al., 2005), and finally questions about design of new forms of collaboration support that may be enabled by this technology (Gweon et al., 2006; Wang et al., 2007a; Kumar et al., 2007). Using our automatic process analysis technology, we have achieved almost human reliability on automatic application of an existing collaborative learning process analysis coding scheme (Weinberger & Fischer, 2006) to newsgroup style data from a number of large studies of script based support for computer supported collaborative learning in Germany (Donmez et al., 2005; Wang et al., 2007). Using this same analysis technology in conjunction with adaptive support agents (Wang et al., 2006; Kumar et al., 2006), we have run successful collaborative learning studies both in Taiwan (Wang et al., 2007a) and in the US (Kumar et al., 2007). This inter-disciplinary research endeavor brings together three large bodies of work, namely work on international standards for assessment of achievement in science and math education (Chang, 2005; Chang & Tsai, 2005) from the science education community, text classification technology (Rosé & VanLehn, 2005; Wang et al., 2007) in the language technologies community, and work on scripted collaboration (Weinberger, 2003; Weinberger & Fischer, 2006) in the computer-supported collaborative learning community. An important outcome of our research to date has been the development of the publicly available toolkit, TagHelper tools http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~cprose/TagHelper.html), which has been developed to support the analysis of verbal data using text classification technology.

Abstract: We present our ongoing work towards using the concept of transactivity [1] for automatically assessing learning of students working together in a collaborative setting. Transactive segments of student dialogue are proposed as useful components of conversation summaries generated for instructors. Experimental evaluation of this hypothesis shows promising results. Further, initial results are presented for automatic identification of transactive contributions in student dialogue.

Abstract: Idea generation is a cognitive process that plays a central role in inquiry learning tasks. This paper presents results from a controlled experiment in which we investigate the affect on productivity and learning from doing idea generation tasks individually versus in pairs, with versus without automatic support from a virtual brainstorming agent called VIBRANT. Our finding is that individuals brainstorming with VIBRANT produced more ideas than individuals who brainstormed with a human peer. However, an additional finding is that while brainstorming in pairs lead to short term process losses in terms of idea generation, with a corresponding reduction in learning in terms of pre to post test gains, it produced a productivity gain for a subsequent distinct individual inquiry task. Furthermore, automatically generated feedback from VIBRANT improved learning during idea generation but did not mitigate the process losses that were associated with reduced learning in the pairs conditions.

Abstract: TuTalk supports the rapid development of dialogue agents for learning applications. It enables an experimenter to create a dialogue agent with either minimal or no programming and provides the infrastructure needed for testing hypotheses about dialogue. Our main goals in developing this tool were to provide 1) an authoring interface and language for setting up the domain knowledge and resources needed to support the agent and 2) a plug-and-play type of system that facilitates the integration of new modules and experimentation with different core modules. In this paper we describe the authoring tool and the usability studies that have shaped its design, the dialogue that is supported and features of the authoring language and their usage history.

Abstract: Expertise to assist people on complex tasks is often in short supply. One solution to this problem is to design systems that allow remote experts to help multiple people in simultaneously. As a first step towards building such a system, we studied experts' attention and communication as they assisted two novices at the same time in a co-located setting. We compared simultaneous instruction when the novices are being instructed to do the same task or different tasks. Using machine learning, we attempted to identify speech markers of upcoming attention shifts that could serve as input to a remote assistance system.

Evaluating the Effect of Social Conversation on Learning , Interaction , and Perceived Interdependence in a Collaborative Math Problem Solving Environment. Abstract: In this paper, we explore the effect of social prompts offered by a computer supported collaborative learning (CSCL) environment on student attitudes and behavior towards each other. We do this by experimentally contrasting collaboration in two configurations, one that presents students with social questions in between math problems and then uses the answers to those problems to tailor the cover story and associated hints for the next problem, and a control condition that uses the same problems, but does not use social questions for tailoring. Our finding is that the social prompts changed the attitude students displayed towards one another. Whereas in the control condition students took on a more competitive attitude, in the experimental condition students were more playful. On the questionnaire students reported exchanging more help in the experimental condition. An analysis of the corpus reveals no significant differences in amount of help exchanged, but there was a significant difference in terms of non-help-related conversation such that the proportion of episodes where help was provided was higher in the Experimental condition. In terms of learning gains, the trend was consistently in favor of the experimental condition in terms of learning between the pretest and the quizzes after each lab session as well as the posttest, however these trends were not statistically significant overall. The strongest learning result is that students in the experimental condition learned marginally more on one unit of the material on the second lab day than students in the control condition (p=.06, effect size .55 standard deviations).

Abstract: In this paper we explore the use of text processing technology for on-line assessment in an engineering design project class. We present results from a 5-week classroom study in a capstone engineering design course in which we explore the potential benefits of such technology for student learning in this context. Furthermore, we present results from ongoing work assessing student productivity based on features extracted from their conversational behavior in the course discussion board. While we found that typical shallow productivity measures such as number of posts, length of posts, or number of files committed have no correlation with an instructor assigned grade, we can achieve a substantial improvement using simple linguistic patterns extracted from on-line conversational behavior.© 2007 ASME

As an educational tool, it has been used as part of a unit on protocol analysis in an Educational Research Methods course.

Abstract: This paper describes results from a series of experimental studies to explore issues related to structuring productive group dynamics for collaborative learning using an adaptive support mechanism. The first study provides evidence in favor of the feasibility of the endeavor by demonstrating with a tightly controlled study that even without adaptive support, problem solving in pairs is significantly more effective for learning than problem solving alone. The results from a second study offer guidelines for strategic matching of students with learning partners. Furthermore, the results reveal specific areas for needed support. Based on the results from the second study, we present the design of an adaptive support mechanism, which we evaluate in a third study. The results from the third study provide evidence that certain aspects of our design for adaptive support in the form of strategic prompts are effective for manipulating student behavior in productive ways and for supporting learning. These results also motivate specific modifications to the original design.

Abstract: People come to online communities seeking information, encouragement, and conversation. When a community responds, participants benefit and become more committed. Yet interactions often fail. In a longitudinal sample of 6,172 messages from 8 Usenet newsgroups, 27% of posts received no response. The information context, posters' prior engagement in the community, and the content of their posts all influenced the likelihood that they received a reply, and, as a result, their willingness to continue active participation. Posters were less likely to get a reply if they were newcomers. Posting ontopic, introducing oneself via autobiographical testimonials, asking questions, using less complex language and other features of the messages, increased replies. Results suggest ways that developers might increase the ability of online communities to support successful individual-group interactions.

The goal is to support further work in knowledge acquisition from informants who are not necessarily experienced with knowledge representations. This work investigates the question: How can we present detailed ontological information to such informants, in a format that is easy to understand, modify, and augment? We compare three formats: two commonly-used diagram styles and one lisp-like list of knowledge axioms. Ongoing work on this topic will expand the investigation into a study of the role of natural language in knowledge acquisition.

Abstract: We report results from a small Wizard-of-Oz study investigating user responses to miscommunications in speech dialogue systems. We explore the separate and joint effects of miscommunication rate and system response to miscommunications on the likelihood that users choose to resort to direct manipulation, to repeat, or to rephrase. While we predicted that users would be more likely to resort to direct manipulation as miscommunication rate increased, our surprising finding was that users were most likely to resort to direct manipulation where communication success was least predictable, i.e., in the middle of the range, rather than at either extreme.

Abstract: In this article, we discuss the motivation for a novel style of tutorial dialogue system that emphasizes reflection in a simulation based exploratory learning environment called CyclePad, which was developed in order to offer students practice at design and optimization of thermodynamic cycles. We argue that while typical forms of exploration support offered in simulation based learning environments are meant to encourage the development of good exploration process skills, the instantiation of these typical forms of support in CyclePad are not sufficient, primarily because students don't choose to use them. We present a preliminary cognitive task analysis of design exploration tasks using CyclePad. Using this cognitive task analysis, we analyze data collected in two waves of formal data collection. Finally, we conclude with some system desiderata derived from our analysis as well as discussion of directions for continued experimental investigations related to tutor style.

Abstract: In this paper we discuss issues related to speeding up parsing with wide-coverage unification grammars. We demonstrate that state-of-the-art optimisation techniques based on backbone parsing before unification do not provide a general solution, because they depend on specific properties of the grammar formalism that do not hold for all unification based grammars. As an alternative, we describe an optimisation technique that combines ambiguity packing at the constituent structure level with pruning based on local features.

Abstract: This paper presents a method for speeding up a deep parser through backbone extraction and pruning based on CFG ambiguity packing. The TRIPS grammar is a wide-coverage grammar for deep natural language understanding in dialogue, utilized in 6 different application domains, and with high coverage and sentence-level accuracy on human-human task-oriented dialogue corpora (Dzikovska, 2004). The TRIPS parser uses a best-first beam search algorithm and a chart size limit, both of which are a form of pruning focused on finding an n-best list of interpretations. However, for longer sentences limiting the chart size results in failed parses, while increasing the chart size limits significantly impacts the parsing speed.

Abstract: Our goal is to develop tools for facilitating the authoring of conversational agents for educational applications, and in particular to enable non-computational linguists to accomplish this task efficiently. Such a tool would benefit both learning researchers, allowing them to study dialogue in new ways, and educational technology researchers, allowing them to quickly build dialogue based help systems for tutoring systems. We argue in favor of a user-centered design methodology. We present our work-in-progress design for authoring, which is motivated by our previous tool development experiences and preliminary contextual interviews and then refined through user testing and iterative design.

Abstract: We combined two existing methods for rapid tutor development: “plug-in tutor agents” [6] and an authoring tool suite (CTAT) that supports the creation of tutors “by demonstration” [2]. The combined approach, which has not been tried before, is suited for adding tutoring capabilities to an existing problem-solving environment, for example an off-the-shelf simulator. Connecting the components (i.e., the simulator and CTAT) requires programming but once that is done, “Pseudo Tutors” are created “by demonstration. Following this approach, we created plug-in Pseudo Tutor agents for a thermodynamics simulator, CyclePad [1], which were tried out in a classroom experiment involving 92 college students. The experiment demonstrates that the Pseudo Tutor technology is viable in a complex domain and that Ritter and Koedinger's protocol for the tool-tutor communication is suited for use in an authoring environment.

This approach, referred to as Negotiable Problem Solving Goals (NPSG), is located on a previously untested space on what we call The Exploratory Learning Continuum. The results of our empirical classroom investigation provide design recommendations for a new type of tutorial dialogue system and strong evidence in favor of tutorial dialogue support in exploratory learning environments.

Abstract: When is Reading Just as Effective as One-on-One Interactive Human Tutoring? Kurt VanLehn (vanlehn@cs.pitt.edu), Art Graesser (agraesser@memphis.edu), G. Tanner Jackson (gtjacksn@memphis.edu), Pamela Jordan (pjordan@pitt.edu), Andrew Olney (aolney@memphis.edu), Carolyn P. Rose (cprose@cs.cmu.edu) Learning Research and Development Center, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA 15260 USA and Institute for Intelligent Systems, University of Memphis, Memphis, TN USA Abstract Many human tutorial dialogues have a similar format (Graesser, Person & Magliano, 1995) wherein the tutor poses a question, the student answers it, and they work collaboratively to improve the student’s answer. We hypothesized that the well-known effectiveness of human tutoring was due to the last phase, and in particular, to the interactive nature of the tutorial dialogue there. To test the hypothesis, we compared tutoring which held constant the first two steps, the question and the student’s initial answer, and varied whether the student engaged in tutorial dialogue or simply read an explanation of how to derive a correct answer. To our surprise, the initial experiment showed equal learning gains. Two further experiments painted a confusing picture, but it is safe to say that interactive tutoring is not always superior to reading. Keywords: Natural language tutoring, dialogue, tutoring, learning, qualitative physics Introduction In the scientific literature, the educational enterprise, and the general public, expert human tutors are believed to provide better instruction than computer tutors or classroom teaching. Many studies (reviewed below) have tried to isolate the source of human tutors’ effectiveness. The present paper adds to the accumulating evidence. First, let us describe the type of tutoring under study. Graesser, Person and Magliano (1995) found that much human tutoring followed a 5-step pattern: 1. The tutor poses a question or problem. 2. The student attempts to answer it. 3. The tutor provides brief evaluative feedback. 4. The tutor and student collaboratively improve the answer or solution. This can involve a moderately long dialogue. 5. The tutor ends the discussion, often by asking the student if they understand, and almost always getting a positive response. Here is an example: 1. Tutor: What does a t-test tell you? 2. Student: It tests whether a mean is significant. 3. Tutor: Sorta. 4. Tutor: Can it be applied to experiments with just one group, or do you need two or more groups? Student: More than one. Tutor: Right. Because the t-test compares the means of the two groups. What does it tell you about the two means? Student: Whether they are significant. Tutor: Almost. What you care about is whether one mean is really and truly higher than the other, or whether the difference between them is just an accident of sampling. Does the t-test tell you anything about that? Student: Yes. 5. Tutor: So do you understand the t-test now? Student: Yes. Tutor: Good. Let’s go on. Graesser et al. (1995) hypothesized that the effectiveness of tutoring lies in the tutorial dialogue of step 4, and in particular, that it is the interactive nature of that dialogue which accelerates learning. For instance, learning would probably be harmed if students simply listened or read an explanation at step 4 instead of participating in a dialogue. This hypothesis is consistent with several earlier studies of human tutoring. Wood, Wood and Middleton (1978) had a human tutor implement 4 different strategies for teaching preschool children how to assemble a complicated block structure. One strategy implemented the following rule: “If the child succeeds, when next intervening offer less help. If the child fails, when next intervening take over more control.” (Wood et al, 1978, pg 133). The other strategies were less interactive. For instance, the least interactive strategy had the tutor just demonstrate the to-be-learned procedure. As predicted by the interaction hypothesis, the most interactive tutoring strategy produced the best performance on a post-test. Swanson (1992) compared the highly interactive tutoring strategy of Wood et al. (1978) to simply lecturing. As in the Wood study, the same tutor implemented both forms of instruction, but Swanson’s students were college students learning how lens work. As predicted by the interaction hypothesis, the more interactive tutoring produced more gains. Swanson also found that a second tutor could not learn to be interactive, and tended to lecture in both conditions. Chi et al. (2001) took advantage of the propensity of untrained tutors to lecture, and first had a group of tutors work with tutees naturally. These tutors were then trained to

Abstract: The study presented in this paper evaluates current progress in a long term effort to provide behavior oriented authoring tools to user interface developers to facilitate rapid development of advanced language understanding interfaces. The results of our study show promise that authors with very little training in computational linguistics can perform nearly as well as graduate students in a language technologies program at tasks that isolate the individual skills required to use our authoring interface for building language understanding interfaces. We discuss implications of these results as well as current directions in this long term project.

Abstract: Process analyses are becoming more and more standard in research on computer-supported collaborative learning. This paper presents the rational as well as results of an evaluation of a tool called TagHelper, designed for streamlining the process of multi-dimensional analysis of the collaborative learning process. In comparison with a hand-coded corpus coded with a 7 dimensional coding scheme, TagHelper is able to achieve an acceptable level of agreement (Cohen's Kappa of .7 or more) along 6 out of 7 of the dimensions when we commit only to the portion of the corpus where the predictor has the highest certainty. In 5 of those cases, the percentage of the corpus where the predictor is confident enough to commit a code is at least 88% of the corpus. Consequences for theory-building with respect to automatic corpus analysis are formulated. Potential applications as a support tool for process analyses, as real-time support for facilitators of on-line discussions, and for the development of more adaptive instructional support for computer-supported collaboration are discussed.

Our current research focuses on the hypothesis that negotiation-style dialogue will lead to better learning than previous tutorial dialogue systems because (1) it motivates students to explain more in order to justify their thinking, and (2) it supports the students’ meta-cognitive ability to ask themselves the right questions about the choices they make.

Abstract: In this paper we present an evaluation of Carmel-Tools, a novel behavior orientedapproach to authoring and maintaining domain specific knowledge sources for robust sentence-level language understanding. Carmel-Tools provides a layer of abstraction between the author and the knowledge sources, freeing up the author to focus on the desired language processing behaviorthat is desired in the target system rather than the linguistic details of the knowledge sources that would make this behavior possible. Furthermore, CarmelTools offers greater flexibility in output representation than the context-free rewrite rules produced by previous semantic authoring tools, allowing authors to design their own predicate language representations.

Abstract: AutoTutor is a computer program that is designed to tutor students in computer literacy or conceptual physics, by simulating the tutoring strategies used by human tutors. AutoTutor interacts with students and attempts to cover the topic material through the course of a natural conversation. During this interaction, AutoTutor uses specific dialog moves to: elicit knowledge from the student, correct student errors, and elaborate/summarize the covered material. Previous research on human tutoring has demonstrated the complex relationship between dialog moves and their effects on student learning gains. The current research with AutoTutor is aimed at examining the relationship between dialog moves and student learning as well as the program’s ability to use dialog to model the student users.

Abstract: It is undoubtedly true that one prominent component of effective human tutoring is collaborative dialogue between student and tutor [7, 12]. Nevertheless, many important questions remain to be answered about which features of human tutorial dialogue make it effective and how the most effective human tutoring strategies can be implemented in a tutorial dialogue system. In this paper we present an analysis of a corpus of human tutoring dialogues where we examine which features correlate significantly with learning gains. In particular we explore the role of Why questions and other open ended questions in creating opportunities for student learning as well as the role of explicit negative feedback for wrong answers.
- C. Rosé, D. Litman, Dumisizwe Bhembe, K. Forbes, Scott Silliman, Ramesh Srivastava, K. VanLehn. 2003. A Comparison of Tutor and Student Behavior in Speech Versus Text Based Tutoring. Abstract: This paper describes preliminary work in exploring the relative effectiveness of speech versus text based tutoring. Most current tutorial dialogue systems are text based (Evens et al., 2001; Rose and Aleven, 2002; Zinn et al., 2002; Aleven et al., 2001; VanLehn et al., 2002). However, prior studies have shown considerable benefits of tutoring through spoken interactions (Lemke, 1990; Chi et al., 1994; Hausmann and Chi, 2002). Thus, we are currently developing a speech based dialogue system that uses a text based system for tutoring conceptual physics (VanLehn et al., 2002) as its "back-end". In order to explore the relative effectiveness between these two input modalities in our task domain, we have started by collecting parallel human-human tutoring corpora both for text based and speech based tutoring. In both cases, students interact with the tutor through a web interface. We present here a comparison between the two on a number of features of dialogue that have been demonstrated to correlate reliably with learning gains with students interacting with the tutor using the text based interface (Rose et al., submitted).

Abstract: We present CarmelTC, a novel hybrid text classification approach for analyzing essay answers to qualitative physics questions, which builds upon work presented in (Rose et al., 2002a). CarmelTC learns to classify units of text based on features extracted from a syntactic analysis of that text as well as on a Naive Bayes classification of that text. We explore the tradeoffs between symbolic and "bag of words" approaches. Our goal has been to combine the strengths of both of these approaches while avoiding some of the weaknesses. Our evaluation demonstrates that the hybrid CarmelTC approach outperforms two "bag of words" approaches, namely LSA and a Naive Bayes, as well as a purely symbolic approach.

Abstract: In this paper we present Carmel-Tools, a new set of authoring tools for overcoming the knowledge engineering bottleneck for building tutorial dialogue systems that can accept natural language text input from students. Carmel-Tools provides the facilities for speeding up and simplifying the task of creating domain specific knowledge sources for sentence level language understanding. Carmel-Tools can build up domain specific lexical resources automatically from raw human tutoring corpora. It provides a GUI interface for authors to design their own first order propositional representation as well as facilities for annotating example sentences with their corresponding interpretation in this designed representational language. It then generalizes over these annotations and automatically generates all domain specific semantic knowledge sources required for interpreting novel input texts that are similar in content to those that have been annotated.

Abstract: In this paper we describe ROSENHEIM, the RObust SENtence level arcHitecture for Efficient Incremental Multi-sentence interpretation. Its efficiency is the result of its novel layered scheduling algorithm. This scheduling algorithm makes it possible to ensure that when edits are made to already processed portions of text, only the minimum changes are made to the chart. Thus, it allows the parser to take advantage of the user's typing or speaking time so that it can complete the majority of the work of parsing an input text before the user enters the last word. Our evaluation demonstrates that this layered architecture makes the parser's response time almost imperceptible. We also show that our incremental parser performs more efficiently than other well known incremental parsers [34] [20]. An implementation of the ROSENHEIM architecture is currently part of the WHY Conceptual Physics Tutoring System [28], one of several recent dialogue based tutoring Systems [23] [1] [7] [11].

In this paper we present a formal com- parison of Socratic versus Didactic style tutoring that ar- gues in favor of the Socratic tutoring style. Introduction Comparative studies of student learning have already demonstrated that one-on-one human tutoring is more ef- fective than other modes of instruction. Tutoring raises students’ proficiency as measured by pre and post-tests by a minimum of 0.40 standard deviations with peer tu- tors (Cohen et al., 1982), and to up to 2.0 standard devia- tions with experienced tutors (Bloom, 1984). One promi- nent component of effective human tutoring is collab- orative dialogue between student and tutor (Fox, 1993; Graesser et al., 1995; Merrill et al., 1992). Nevertheless, a great deal of controversy surrounds the issue of which features of tutorial dialogue distinguish effective uses of dialogue in tutoring from those that are less effective. In this paper we present the results of a formal evalua- tion of the relative effectiveness of Socratic versus Didac- tic tutoring in a simulated problem solving environment in the Basic Electricity and Electronics domain. In this study, the Socratic tutoring style is characterized by an emphasis on eliciting information from students through a directed line of reasoning. Thus, the tutor endeavors as much as possible to avoid giving information away. In contrast, in the Didactic tutoring style, the tutor be- gins extended interactions with students by presenting the student with an explanation of the material the student is meant to learn in the interaction. After the initial expla- nation, the tutor leads the student through a directed line of reasoning similar to that used in the Socratic condition, except that the questioning plays more of a role of draw- ing the student’s attention to information that the tutor has already explained, rather than eliciting this information from the student. Since drawing the student’s attention to the points already articulated by the tutor requires less from the students, the Didactic interactions tended to be significantly shorter than the Socratic interactions. They contained only 70% as many open ended questions and had more of a lecture like flavor than the Socratic inter- actions. In a classroom instructional context, it has been well argued that receptive learning, i.e., by means of lectures, can be just as effective as discovery based learning pro- vided that students have the requisite prior knowledge to learn the presented material meaningfully rather than by rote (Ausubel, 1978). However, this view has not been universally accepted by educational psychologists (Pi- aget, 1973; Vygotsky, 1978). Furthermore, one key dif- ference between tutoring and classroom learning is that there is much more continuity and regularity in classroom learning. In contrast, tutoring is sporadic and decontex- tualized. Thus, within a classroom setting the teacher is much more familiar with the students’ prior knowledge, and is in fact in a position to ensure that students are pre- pared to learn the material that is presented each day by arranging lessons to build one upon another. We argue that because this is not the case in a tutoring context, it is more critical to draw out the student’s thought process in order to tailor the presentation of material to the students’ needs. Previous studies have argued the effectiveness of So- cratic and other similar tutoring approaches. Recent re- search on student self-explanations supports the view that when students explain their thinking out loud it en- hances their learning (Chi et al., 1989, Chi et al., 1994, Renkl, submitted). Students learn more effectively when they are given the opportunity to discover knowledge for themselves (Brown and Kane, 1988; Lovett, 1992; Press- ley et al., 1992). Collins and Stevens (1982) report that the best teachers tend to use a Socratic tutoring style. A tutoring system based on the Collins and Stevens model (Wong et al., 1998) has received favorable reviews al- though it has not yet been subjected to a formal compar- ative evaluation. Nevertheless, other studies have argued the effective- ness of Didactic style tutoring. In a recent study in which students read previously solved probability prob- lems (Renkl, submitted), an experimental group that had the option to request further tutor explanation performed better than a control group that did not have that op- tion, with an effect size of .5 sigma. Albacete (1999) found that students who received Didactic conceptual minilessons when they made errors learned more than students who received immediate flag feedback and could

Abstract: Many of the intelligent tutoring systems that have been developed during the last 20 years have proven to be quite successful, particularly in the domains of mathematics, science, and technology. They produce significant learning gains beyond classroom environments. They are capable of engaging most students' attention and interest for hours. We have been working on a new generation of intelligent tutoring systems that hold mixed-initiative conversational dialogues with the learner. The tutoring systems present challenging problems and questions to the learner, the learner types in answers in English, and there is a lengthy multiturn dialogue as complete solutions or answers evolve. This article presents the tutoring systems that we have been developing. AutoTutor is a conversational agent, with a talking head, that helps college students learn about computer literacy. andes, atlas, and why2 help adults learn about physics. Instead of being mere information-delivery systems, our systems help students actively construct knowledge through conversations.

Abstract: This paper describes the AUTOSEM syntactic framework for semantic interpretation and the CARMEL robust understanding engine in which it operates. This work has been developed as part of an effort to build tools for authoring broad coverage natural language understanding interfaces for intelligent tutoring systems. Its purpose is to provide a solid foundation for interpretation that will facilitate rapid development of domain specific interfaces [Freedman et al., 2000].
- C. Rosé. 2000. A Framework for Robust Semantic Interpretation Learning. Abstract: This paper describes AUTOSEM, a robust semantic interpretation framework that can operate both at parse time and repair time. The evaluation demonstrates that AUTOSEM achieves a high level of robustness efficiently and without requiring any hand coded knowledge dedicated to repair. 1 I n t r o d u c t i o n In order for an approach to robust interpretation to be practical it must be efficient, address the major types of disfluencies that plague spontaneously produced language input, and be domain independent so thatachieving robustness in a particular domain does not require an additional knowledge engineering effort. This paper describes AUTOSEM, a semantic interpretation framework that possesses these three qualities. While previous approaches to robust interpretation have offered robust parsers paired with separate repair modules~ with separate knowledge sources for each, AUTOSEM is a single unified framework that can operate both at parse time and repair time. AUTOSEM is integrated with the LCFLEx robust parser (Ros@ and Lavie, to appear; Lavie and Ros@, 2000). Together AUTOSEM and LCFLEx constitute the robust understanding engine within the CARMEL natural language understanding component developed in the context of the Atlas intelligent tutoring project (Freedman at al., to appear). The evaluation reported here demonstrates that AUTOSEM's repair approach operates 200 times faster than the most similar competing approach while producing hypotheses of better quality. AUTOSEM provides an interface to allow semantic interpretation to operate in parallel with syntactic interpretation at parse time in a lexicon driven fashion. Domain specific semantic knowledge is encoded declaratively within a meaning representation specification. Semantic constructor functions are compiled automatically from this specification and then linked into lexical entries as in the Glue Language Semantics approach to interpretation (Dalrymple, 1999). Based on syntactic head/argument relationships assigned at parse time, the constructot functions enforce semantic selectiona] restrictions and assemble meaning representation structures by composing the meaning representation associated with the constructor function with the meaning representation of each of its arguments. AUTOSEM first a t tempts to construct analyses that satisfy both syntactic and semantic wellformedness conditions. The LCFLEx parser has the ability to efficiently relax syntactic constraints as needed and as allowed by its parameterized flexibility settings. For sentences remaining beyond the parser's coverage, AUTOSEM's repair algorithm relies entirely on semantic knowledge to compose the partial analyses produced by the parser. Each semantic representation built by AUTOSEM's interpretation framework contains a pointer to the constructor function that built it. Thus, each partial analysis can be treated as a constructor function with built in knowledge about how the associated partial analysis can be combined with other partial analyses in a semantically meaningful way. Genetic programming search (Koza, 1992; Koza, 1994) is used to efficiently compose the fragments produced by the parser. The function definitions compiled from the meaning representation specification allow the genetic search to use semantic constraints to make effective use of its search space. Thus, AUTOSEM operates efficiently, free of any hand coded repair rules or any knowledge specifically dedicated to repair unlike other approaches to recovery from parser failure (Danieli and Gerbino, 1995; Van Noord, 1997; Kasper et al., 1999). 2 T h e M e a n i n g R e p r e s e n t a t i o n S p e c i f i c a t i o n At the heart of AUTOSEM is its interpretation framework composed of semantic constructor functions compiled from a meaning representation specification. These semantic constructor functions can be used at parse time to build up semantic representations. These same constructor functions can then be used in a repair stage to compose the fragments returned by the parser in the cases where the parser is not able to obtain a complete analysis for an ex-
- A. Lavie, C. Rosé. 1998. A Domain Independent Approach for Efficiently Interpreting Extragrammatical Utterances. Abstract: In this paper we address the issue of eeciently and eeectively handling the problem of extragrammaticality in a large-scale spontaneous spoken language system. We propose and argue in favor of ROSE, a domain independent parse-and-repair approach to the problem of interpreting extragrammaticalities in spontaneous language input. We argue that in order for an approach to robust interpretation to be practical, it must be domain independent, eecient, and eeective. Where previous approaches to robust interpretation possessed one or two of these qualities, the ROSE approach uniquely possesses all three. We evaluate our approach by comparing its performance in terms of parse time and quality 2 Ros e and Lavie with a parameterized version of the minimum distance parsing (MDP) approach as well as with a more restrictive partial parser, two alternative domain independent approaches. Our analysis demonstrates that the ROSE approach performs signiicantly faster than a limited version of MDP, while producing analyses of superior quality. We also demonstrate that the two stage ROSE approach achieves a higher level of quality in less time than a more restrictive partial parser. We believe these results support the claim that in general two stage approaches like ROSE achieve high quality results more eeciently than one stage approaches.
- C. Rosé, L. Levin. 1998. An Interactive Domain Independent Approach to Robust Dialogue Interpretation. Abstract: We discuss an interactive approach to robust, interpretation in a large scale speech-to-speech translation system. Where other interactive approaches to robust interpretation ha,re depeuded upon domain dependent repair rules, the approach described here operates etIiciently without any such hand-coded repair knowledge and yields a 37% reduction in error rate over a corpus of noisy sentences. 1 I n t r o d u c t i o n Iu this paper we discuss lt.OSE, all interactive ap1)roach to robust interpretation developed in the context of the JANUS speech-to-speech translation system (Lavie et al., 1996). Previous interactive approaches to robust interl)retation have either required excessive amounts of interaction (II.os~ and Wail)el, 1994), depended upon domain dependent repair rules (Van Noord, 1996; l)anieli and Gerbino, 1995), or relied on the rninimum distance parsing approach (Hipp, 1992; Smith, 1992; Lehman, 11989) which has been shown to be intractable in a largescale system (F/.os~ and Lavie, 1997). in contrast, the ROSE approach operates efficiently without any hand-coded repair knowledge. All empirical evaluation demonstrates the efficacy of t.his domain independent approach. A further evaluation demonstrates that the ROSE approach combines easily with available domain knowledge in order to improve the quMity of the interaction. The ROSE approach is based on a model of human comnmnication between speakers of different languages with a small shared language base. Humans who share a very small language base are able to communicate when the need arises by simplifying their speech patterns and negotiating until they manage to transmit their ideas to one another (Hatch, 1983). As the speaker is speaking, the listener "casts his net" in order to catch those fragments of speech that are comprehensible to him, which he then attempts to fit together semantically. His subsequent negotiation with the speaker builds upon this partial understanding. Similarly, ROSE repairs ext.ragranmlatical input in two phases. The first phase, Repair ltypothesis Formation, is responsible for assembling a set of hypotheses about the meaning of the ungrammatical utterance. In the second phase, hlteraetion with the User, the system generates a set of queries, negotiating with the speaker in order to narrow down to a single best meaning representation hypothesis. This approach was evaluated in the context of the JANUS multi-lingual machine translation system. First, the system obtains a meaning representation for a sentence uttered in the source language. Then the resulting meaning representation structure is mapped onto a sentence in the target language using GENKIT (Tomita and Nyberg, 1988) with a sentence level generation grammar. Currently, the translation system deals with tlle scheduling domain where two speakers at tempt to schedule a meeting together over the l)hone. This paper focuses on the Interaction phase. Details about the llypothesis Formation phase are found ill (Rosd, 1997). 2 I n t e r a c t i v e R e p a i r In D e p t h As mentioned above, ROSE repairs extragrammatical input ill two phases. The first phase, t{epair ttypothesis Fornmtion, is responsible for assembling a ranked set of tell or fewer hypotheses about the meaning of the ungrammatical utterance expressed in the source language. This phase is itself divided into two stages, Partial Parsing and Combination. The Partial Parsing stag(" is similar to the concept of the listener "casting his net" for comprehensible fi'agments of speech. A robust skipping parser (Lavie, 1995) is used to obtain an analysis for islands of the speaker's sentence. Ill the Combination stage, the fi'agments fi'om the partial parse are assembled into a ranked set of alternative nmaning representation hypotheses. A genetic programming (Koza, 1992; Koza, 1994) approach is used to search for dill>rent ways to combine the fi'agments in order to avoid requiring any hand-crafted repair rules. Our genetic programming approach has been shown previously to be orders of magnitude more efficient than the mininmm distance parsing approach (Rosd and Lavie, 1997).

- C. Rosé. 1997. An Efficient Two Stage Approach to Robust Language Interpretation. Abstract: The most basic task of a natural language interface is to map the user's utterance onto some meaning representation which can then be used for further processing. The three biggest challenges which continue to stand in the way of accomplishing even this most basic task are extragrammaticality, ambiguity, and recognition errors. The system presented here, ROSE1: RObustness with Structural Evolution, repairs extragrammatical input in two stages. The first stage, Repair Hypothesis Formation, is responsible for assembling a set of hypotheses about the meaning of the ungrammatical utterance. This stage is itself divided into two steps, Partial Parsing and Combination. In the Combination step, the fragments from a partial parse are assembled into a set of meaning representation hypotheses. In ROSE's second stage, Interaction with the user, the system generates a set of queries and then uses the user's answers to these queries to narrow down to a single best meaning representation hypothesis.
- C. Rosé, A. Lavie. 1997. An Efficient Distribution of Labor in a Two Stage Robust Interpretation Process. Abstract: Although Minimum Distance Parsing (MDP) offers a theoretically attractive solution to the problem of extragrammaticality, it is often computationally infeasible in large scale practical applications. In this paper we present an alternative approach where the labor is distributed between a more restrictive partial parser and a repair module. Though two stage approaches have grown in popularity in recent years because of their efficiency, they have done so at the cost of requiring hand coded repair heuristics. In contrast, our two stage approach does not require any hand coded knowledge sources dedicated to repair, thus making it possible to achieve a similar run time advantage over MDP without losing the quality of domain independence.

We discuss and evaluate two different methods for combining context based predictions with non context based predictions, namely a genetic programming approach and a neural network approach. We demonstrate the advantage of incorporating context-based predictions over the purely non context-based approach discussed in (Lavie, 1995). The results presented here show a significant improvement over our previous results reported in (Levin et al., 1995).

By drawing upon both statistical and symbolic information, it constrains its rcpair hypotheses to those which are both likely and meaningful. Because it updates its statistical model during use, it improves its performance over time.

Abstract: Some previous studies of student learning have demonstrated a strong advantage in favor of human tutoring over a classroom control condition (Bloom, 1984; Cohen et al., 1982). These results have spawned an optimistic view towards building effective tutorial dialogue systems. Towards this end, many current tutorial dialogue systems have been evaluated successfully with students [21, 15, 1, 11, 8]. Nevertheless, so far none have demonstrated conclusively that tutorial dialogue systems provide a more effective or efficient means of instruction than an otherwise equivalent purely text based approach. In this paper we explore the question of whether it is even true that human tutoring is always superior to a reading control. In recent years much attention has been given to questions about tutorial dialogue, in particular about what makes it effective and in which contexts. The current study was motivated by the hypothesis that dialogue may be a more appropriate means of instruction for naive learners than for review learners. In this study review learners are those who have been exposed to the material in a formal classroom setting but have not yet mastered the material. Our study focuses on learning conceptual physics. We used two different populations of students. In particular, the first population of students were those who were in the middle of taking or had already taken a semester of college level physics. Thus, for these students the topics covered in the study were a review of what they had already learned in class but did not yet master (as indicated by pretest scores). The second population of students were those who had never taken any college level physics. While students in both conditions demonstrated a significant difference in performance between the pre-test and post-test, there was no significant difference between conditions with the first population, whereas there was a significant difference in gain between the human tutoring condition and the reading control with the second population. This interaction supports the experimental hypothesis and highlights the benefit of adaptation to student knowledge state that dialogue affords. These results also have methodological implications for tutorial dialogue research.

Order Print-on-demand Copies From: a Similar Goal Is a Starting Point of the Contribution Modeling the Interaction between Sensory and Affective Meanings for Detecting Metaphor Exploring Sensorial Features for Metaphor Identification High-precision Abductive Mapping of Multilingual Metaphors a Corpu. Abstract: ii Introduction Characteristic to all areas of human activity (from poetic to ordinary to scientific) and, thus, to all types of discourse, metaphor becomes an important problem for natural language processing. Its ubiquity in language has been established in a number of corpus studies and the role it plays in human reasoning has been confirmed in psychological experiments. This makes metaphor an important research area for computational and cognitive linguistics, and its automatic identification and interpretation indispensable for any semantics-oriented NLP application. This year's workshop is the third Metaphor in NLP workshop, following the first workshop held at NAACL 2013 and the second workshop held at ACL 2014. In 2013, accepted papers dealt with metaphor annotation, features for metaphor identification, and with generalization of the techniques across languages. These themes were also represented in the 2014 workshop, along with interpretation, applications, and relationships with related phenomena. In 2015, prominent themes include creation and utilization of semantic resources for metaphor identification and interpretation; features for metaphor identification that capture properties of concepts such as concreteness, imageability, affect, and sensorial modalities; relationships between social dynamic and individual history and metaphor use; and metaphor generation. We received 13 submissions and accepted 10, based on detailed and careful reviews by members of the Program Committee. Creation and utilization of semantic resources to support metaphor identification is a recurrent theme in the 2015 workshop. An invited talk by Prof. Martha Palmer and Dr. Susan Brown about metaphor in VerbNet was followed by a number of contributions describing the creation of resources in support of metaphor identification and analysis. Li, Bai ,Yin, and Xu describe the construction of a resource where salient properties of concepts expressed by thousands of Chinese verbs and nouns are collected. Dodge, Hong, and Stickles describe MetaNet, a system combining a repository of metaphors and frames, and a metaphor detection component that utilizes the repository. Gordon, Jobbs, May, and Morbini describe an enhancement to their knowledge-based metaphor identification system that infers lexical axioms – rules which encode information about what words or phrases trigger particular source and target concepts. and Wertheim describe their ontology of commonly used source domains and release a corpus of manually validated annotations of linguistic metaphors about governance, economy, and gun control with source and target domains, as well as specific roles (slots) that support the interpretation of the metaphor.

Abstract: Internet chat-based tutorials are being developed for integrating computer modeling and design skills into mechanical engineering undergraduate and middle school outreach programs. These tutorials help students navigate complicated software interfaces while teaching fundamental concepts through dynamic dialogues between tutorial agents and student user groups. In a typical assignment, students are asked to perform a design or modeling task that includes the use of software such as a commercial finite element code or specially designed educational software. Students work in teams, but team members are distributed within a room or between remote sites, linked by a text interface. As students collaborate electronically, an intelligent agent monitors their interactions and interjects questions or comments in response to the use of key phrases, or due to other triggers. This platform is being used to help automate collaborative learning experiences and to study how students can effectively interact with each other and with the software agents. In undergraduate projects, fundamental technical skills and intuition in interpreting results are emphasized. In outreach efforts, participants are led to consider how their work relates to the broad mechanical engineering profession. INTRODUCTION In the past decade, the landscape in which engineering is practiced has been transformed by two trends [1]. First, there
