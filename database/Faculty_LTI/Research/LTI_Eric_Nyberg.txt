GameQA: Gamified Mobile App Platform for Building Multiple-Domain Question-Answering Datasets. Abstract: The methods used to create many of the well-known Question-Answering (QA) datasets are hard to replicate for low-resource languages. A commonality amongst these methods is hiring annotators to source answers from the internet by querying a single answer source, such as Wikipedia. Applying these methods for low-resource languages can be problematic since there is no single large answer source for these languages. Consequently, this can result in a high ratio of unanswered questions, since the amount of information in any single source is limited. To address this problem, we developed a novel crowd-sourcing platform to gather multiple-domain QA data for low-resource languages. Our platform, which consists of a mobile app and a web API, gamifies the data collection process. We successfully released the app for Icelandic (a low-resource language with about 350,000 native speakers) to build a dataset which rivals large QA datasets for high-resource languages both in terms of size and ratio of answered questions. We have made the platform open source with instructions on how to localize and deploy it to gather data for other low-resource languages.

Abstract: We carried out a reproducibility study of InPars, which is a method for unsupervised training of neural rankers (Bonifacio et al., 2022). As a by-product, we developed InPars-light, which is a simple-yet-effective modification of InPars. Unlike InPars, InPars-light uses 7x-100x smaller ranking models and only a freely available language model BLOOM, which -- as we found out -- produced more accurate rankers compared to a proprietary GPT-3 model. On all five English retrieval collections (used in the original InPars study) we obtained substantial (7%-30%) and statistically significant improvements over BM25 (in nDCG and MRR) using only a 30M parameter six-layer MiniLM-30M ranker and a single three-shot prompt. In contrast, in the InPars study only a 100x larger monoT5-3B model consistently outperformed BM25, whereas their smaller monoT5-220M model (which is still 7x larger than our MiniLM ranker) outperformed BM25 only on MS MARCO and TREC DL 2020. In the same three-shot prompting scenario, our 435M parameter DeBERTA v3 ranker was at par with the 7x larger monoT5-3B (average gain over BM25 of 1.3 vs 1.32): In fact, on three out of five datasets, DeBERTA slightly outperformed monoT5-3B. Finally, these good results were achieved by re-ranking only 100 candidate documents compared to 1000 used by Bonifacio et al. (2022). We believe that InPars-light is the first truly cost-effective prompt-based unsupervised recipe to train and deploy neural ranking models that outperform BM25. Our code and data is publicly available. https://github.com/searchivarius/inpars_light/

Language-Agnostic Transformers and Assessing ChatGPT-Based Query Rewriting for Multilingual Document-Grounded QA. Abstract: The DialDoc 2023 shared task has expanded the document-grounded dialogue task to encompass multiple languages, despite having limited annotated data. This paper assesses the effectiveness of both language-agnostic and language-aware paradigms for multilingual pre-trained transformer models in a bi-encoder-based dense passage retriever (DPR), concluding that the language-agnostic approach is superior. Additionally, the study investigates the impact of query rewriting techniques using large language models, such as ChatGPT, on multilingual, document-grounded question-answering systems. The experiments conducted demonstrate that, for the examples examined, query rewriting does not enhance performance compared to the original queries. This failure is due to topic switching in final dialogue turns and irrelevant topics being considered for query rewriting.

Abstract: The retrieval model is an indispensable component for real-world knowledge-intensive tasks, e.g., open-domain question answering (ODQA). As separate retrieval skills are annotated for different datasets, recent work focuses on customized methods, limiting the model transfer- ability and scalability. In this work, we propose a modular retriever where individual modules correspond to key skills that can be reused across datasets. Our approach supports flexible skill configurations based on the target domain to boost performance. To mitigate task interference, we design a novel modularization parameterization inspired by sparse Transformer. We demonstrate that our model can benefit from self-supervised pretraining on Wikipedia and fine-tuning using multiple ODQA datasets, both in a multi-task fashion. Our approach outperforms recent self-supervised retrievers in zero-shot evaluations and achieves state-of-the-art fine-tuned retrieval performance on NQ, HotpotQA and OTT-QA.

Learn-to-Race Challenge 2022: Benchmarking Safe Learning and Cross-domain Generalisation in Autonomous Racing. Abstract: We present the results of our autonomous racing virtual challenge, based on the newly-released Learn-to-Race (L2R) simulation framework, which seeks to encourage interdisciplinary research in autonomous driving and to help advance the state of the art on a realistic benchmark. Analogous to racing being used to test cutting-edge vehicles, we envision autonomous racing to serve as a particularly challenging proving ground for autonomous agents as: (i) they need to make sub-second, safety-critical decisions in a complex, fast-changing environment; and (ii) both perception and control must be robust to distribution shifts, novel road features, and unseen obstacles. Thus, the main goal of the challenge is to evaluate the joint safety, performance, and generalisation capabilities of reinforcement learning agents on multi-modal perception, through a two-stage process. In the first stage of the challenge, we evaluate an autonomous agent's ability to drive as fast as possible, while adhering to safety constraints. In the second stage, we additionally require the agent to adapt to an unseen racetrack through safe exploration. In this paper, we describe the new L2R Task 2.0 benchmark, with refined metrics and baseline approaches. We also provide an overview of deployment, evaluation, and rankings for the inaugural instance of the L2R Autonomous Racing Virtual Challenge (supported by Carnegie Mellon University, Arrival Ltd., AICrowd, Amazon Web Services, and Honda Research), which officially used the new L2R Task 2.0 benchmark and received over 20,100 views, 437 active participants, 46 teams, and 733 model submissions -- from 88+ unique institutions, in 58+ different countries. Finally, we release leaderboard results from the challenge and provide description of the two top-ranking approaches in cross-domain model transfer, across multiple sensor configurations and simulated races.

Abstract: Generalisation to unseen contexts remains a challenge for embodied navigation agents. In the context of semantic audio-visual navigation (SAVi) tasks, the notion of generalisation should include both generalising to unseen indoor visual scenes as well as generalising to unheard sounding objects. However, previous SAVi task definitions do not include evaluation conditions on truly novel sounding objects, resorting instead to evaluating agents on unheard sound clips of known objects; meanwhile, previous SAVi methods do not include explicit mechanisms for incorporating domain knowledge about object and region semantics. These weaknesses limit the development and assessment of models' abilities to generalise their learned experience. In this work, we introduce the use of knowledge-driven scene priors in the semantic audio-visual embodied navigation task: we combine semantic information from our novel knowledge graph that encodes object-region relations, spatial knowledge from dual Graph Encoder Networks, and background knowledge from a series of pre-training tasks -- all within a reinforcement learning framework for audio-visual navigation. We also define a new audio-visual navigation sub-task, where agents are evaluated on novel sounding objects, as opposed to unheard clips of known objects. We show improvements over strong baselines in generalisation to unseen regions and novel sounding objects, within the Habitat-Matterport3D simulation environment, under the SoundSpaces task.

Abstract: Tables are an important form of structured data for both human and machine readers alike, providing answers to questions that cannot, or cannot easily, be found in texts. Recent work has designed special models and training paradigms for table-related tasks such as table-based question answering and table retrieval. Though effective, they add complexity in both modeling and data acquisition compared to generic text solutions and obscure which elements are truly beneficial. In this work, we focus on the task of table retrieval, and ask: “is table-specific model design necessary for table retrieval, or can a simpler text-based model be effectively used to achieve a similar result?’’ First, we perform an analysis on a table-based portion of the Natural Questions dataset (NQ-table), and find that structure plays a negligible role in more than 70% of the cases. Based on this, we experiment with a general Dense Passage Retriever (DPR) based on text and a specialized Dense Table Retriever (DTR) that uses table-specific model designs. We find that DPR performs well without any table-specific design and training, and even achieves superior results compared to DTR when fine-tuned on properly linearized tables. We then experiment with three modules to explicitly encode table structures, namely auxiliary row/column embeddings, hard attention masks, and soft relation-based attention biases. However, none of these yielded significant improvements, suggesting that table-specific model design may not be necessary for table retrieval.

Understanding Performance of Long-Document Ranking Models through Comprehensive Evaluation and Leaderboarding. Abstract: We carry out a comprehensive evaluation of 13 recent models for ranking of long documents using two popular collections (MS MARCO documents and Robust04). Our model zoo includes two specialized Transformer models (such as Longformer) that can process long documents without the need to split them. Along the way, we document several difficulties regarding training and comparing such models. Somewhat surprisingly, we find the simple FirstP baseline (truncating documents to satisfy the input-sequence constraint of a typical Transformer model) to be quite effective. We analyze the distribution of relevant passages (inside documents) to explain this phenomenon. We further argue that, despite their widespread use, Robust04 and MS MARCO documents are not particularly useful for benchmarking of long-document models.

Abstract: Code-switched (CS) data is ubiquitous in today’s globalized world, but the dearth of annotated datasets in code-switching poses a significant challenge for learning diverse tasks across different language pairs. Parameter-efficient prompt-tuning approaches conditioned on frozen language models have shown promise for transfer learning in limited-resource setups. In this paper, we propose a novel instance-based prompt composition technique, PRO-CS, for CS tasks that combine language and task knowledge. We compare our approach with prompt-tuning and fine-tuning for code-switched tasks on 10 datasets across 4 language pairs. Our model outperforms the prompt-tuning approach by significant margins across all datasets and outperforms or remains at par with fine-tuning by using just 0.18% of total parameters. We also achieve competitive results when compared with the fine-tuned model in the low-resource cross-lingual and cross-task setting, indicating the effectiveness of our approach to incorporate new code-switched tasks.
- Kaixin Ma, Filip Ilievski, Jonathan M Francis, Eric Nyberg, A. Oltramari. 2022. Coalescing Global and Local Information for Procedural Text Understanding. Abstract: Procedural text understanding is a challenging language reasoning task that requires models to track entity states across the development of a narrative. We identify three core aspects required for modeling this task, namely the local and global view of the inputs, as well as the global view of outputs. Prior methods have considered a subset of these aspects, which leads to either low precision or low recall. In this paper, we propose a new model Coalescing Global and Local Information (CGLI), which builds entity- and timestep-aware input representations (local input) considering the whole context (global input), and we jointly model the entity states with a structured prediction objective (global output). Thus, CGLI simultaneously optimizes for both precision and recall. Moreover, we extend CGLI with additional output layers and integrate it into a story reasoning framework. Extensive experiments on a popular procedural text understanding dataset show that our model achieves state-of-the-art results, while experiments on a story reasoning benchmark show the positive impact of our model on downstream reasoning.

Abstract: In this paper, we present our submission to the DialDoc shared task based on the MultiDoc2Dial dataset. MultiDoc2Dial is a conversational question answering dataset that grounds dialogues in multiple documents. The task involves grounding a user’s query in a document followed by generating an appropriate response. We propose several improvements over the baseline’s retriever-reader architecture to aid in modeling goal-oriented dialogues grounded in multiple documents. Our proposed approach employs sparse representations for passage retrieval, a passage re-ranker, the fusion-in-decoder architecture for generation, and a curriculum learning training paradigm. Our approach shows a 12 point improvement in BLEU score compared to the baseline RAG model.

Abstract: The feasibility of collecting a large amount of expert demonstrations has inspired growing research interests in learning-to-drive settings, where models learn by imitating the driving behaviour from experts. However, exclusively relying on imitation can limit agents' generalisability to novel scenarios that are outside the support of the training data. In this paper, we address this challenge by factorising the driving task, based on the intuition that modular architectures are more generalisable and more robust to changes in the environment compared to monolithic, end-to-end frameworks. Specifically, we draw inspiration from the trajectory forecasting community and reformulate the learning-to-drive task as obstacle-aware perception and grounding, distribution-aware goal prediction, and model-based planning. Firstly, we train the obstacle-aware perception module to extract salient representation of the visual context. Then, we learn a multi-modal goal distribution by performing conditional density-estimation using normalising flow. Finally, we ground candidate trajectory predictions road geometry, and plan the actions based on on vehicle dynamics. Under the CARLA simulator, we report state-of-the-art results on the CARNOVEL benchmark.

Abstract: We propose a novel open-domain question answering (ODQA) framework for answering single/multi-hop questions across heterogeneous knowledge sources. The key novelty of our method is the introduction of the intermediary modules into the current retriever-reader pipeline. Unlike previous methods that solely rely on the retriever for gathering all evidence in isolation, our intermediary performs a chain of reasoning over the retrieved set. Specifically, our method links the retrieved evidence with its related global context into graphs and organizes them into a candidate list of evidence chains. Built upon pretrained language models, our system achieves competitive performance on two ODQA datasets, OTT-QA and NQ, against tables and passages from Wikipedia. In particular, our model substantially outperforms the previous state-of-the-art on OTT-QA with an exact match score of 47.3 (45 % relative gain).

Abstract: Commonsense reasoning benchmarks have been largely solved by fine-tuning language models. The downside is that fine-tuning may cause models to overfit to task-specific data and thereby forget their knowledge gained during pre-training. Recent works only propose lightweight model updates as models may already possess useful knowledge from past experience, but a challenge remains in understanding what parts and to what extent models should be refined for a given task. In this paper, we investigate what models learn from commonsense reasoning datasets. We measure the impact of three different adaptation methods on the generalization and accuracy of models. Our experiments with two models show that fine-tuning performs best, by learning both the content and the structure of the task, but suffers from overfitting and limited generalization to novel answers. We observe that alternative adaptation methods like prefix-tuning have comparable accuracy, but generalize better to unseen answers and are more robust to adversarial splits.

Learn-to-Race: A Multimodal Control Environment for Autonomous Racing. Abstract: Existing research on autonomous driving primarily focuses on urban driving, which is insufficient for characterising the complex driving behaviour underlying high-speed racing. At the same time, existing racing simulation frameworks struggle in capturing realism, with respect to visual rendering, vehicular dynamics, and task objectives, inhibiting the transfer of learning agents to real-world contexts. We introduce a new environment, where agents Learn-to-Race (L2R) in simulated competition-style racing, using multimodal information—from virtual cameras to a comprehensive array of inertial measurement sensors. Our environment, which includes a simulator and an interfacing training framework, accurately models vehicle dynamics and racing conditions. In this paper, we release the Arrival simulator for autonomous racing. Next, we propose the L2R task with challenging metrics, inspired by learning-to-drive challenges, Formula-style racing, and multimodal trajectory prediction for autonomous driving. Additionally, we provide the L2R framework suite, facilitating simulated racing on high-precision models of real-world tracks. Finally, we provide an official L2R task dataset of expert demonstrations, as well as a series of baseline experiments and reference implementations. We make all code available: https://github.com/learn-to-race/l2r.
- Bingqing Chen, Jonathan M Francis, James Herman, Jean Oh, Eric Nyberg, Sylvia L. Herbert. 2021. Safety-aware Policy Optimisation for Autonomous Racing. Abstract: To be viable for safety-critical applications, such as autonomous driving and assistive robotics, autonomous agents should adhere to safety constraints throughout the interactions with their environments. Instead of learning about safety by collecting samples, including unsafe ones, methods such as Hamilton-Jacobi (HJ) reachability compute safe sets with theoretical guarantees using models of the system dynamics. However, HJ reachability is not scalable to high-dimensional systems, and the guarantees hinge on the quality of the model. In this work, we inject HJ reachability theory into the constrained Markov decision process (CMDP) framework, as a control-theoretical approach for safety analysis via model-free updates on state-action pairs. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the HJ safety value can be learned directly on vision context, the highest-dimensional problem studied via the method to-date. We evaluate our method on several benchmark tasks, including Safety Gym and Learn-to-Race (L2R), a recently-released high-fidelity autonomous racing environment. Our approach has significantly fewer constraint violations in comparison to other constrained RL baselines, and achieve the new state-of-the-art results on the L2R benchmark task. We release our code in the supplementary material.

Abstract: Due to its potential for a universal interface 001 over both data and text, data-to-text genera- 002 tion is becoming increasingly popular.

Abstract: The retriever-reader framework is popular for open-domain question answering (ODQA) due to its ability to use explicit knowledge.Although prior work has sought to increase the knowledge coverage by incorporating structured knowledge beyond text, accessing heterogeneous knowledge sources through a unified interface remains an open question. While data-to-text generation has the potential to serve as a universal interface for data and text, its feasibility for downstream tasks remains largely unknown. In this work, we bridge this gap and use the data-to-text method as a means for encoding structured knowledge for open-domain question answering. Specifically, we propose a verbalizer-retriever-reader framework for ODQA over data and text where verbalized tables from Wikipedia and graphs from Wikidata are used as augmented knowledge sources. We show that our Unified Data and Text QA, UDT-QA, can effectively benefit from the expanded knowledge index, leading to large gains over text-only baselines. Notably, our approach sets the single-model state-of-the-art on Natural Questions. Furthermore, our analyses indicate that verbalized knowledge is preferred for answer reasoning for both adapted and hot-swap settings.

Abstract: Racing demands each vehicle to drive at its physical limits, when any safety infraction could lead to catastrophic failure. In this work, we study the problem of safe reinforcement learning (RL) for autonomous racing, using the vehicle's ego-camera view and speed as input. Given the nature of the task, autonomous agents need to be able to 1) identify and avoid unsafe scenarios under the complex vehicle dynamics, and 2) make sub-second decision in a fast-changing environment. To satisfy these criteria, we propose to incorporate Hamilton-Jacobi (HJ) reachability theory, a safety verification method for general non-linear systems, into the constrained Markov decision process (CMDP) framework. HJ reachability not only provides a control-theoretic approach to learn about safety, but also enables low-latency safety verification. Though HJ reachability is traditionally not scalable to high-dimensional systems, we demonstrate that with neural approximation, the HJ safety value can be learned directly on vision context -- the highest-dimensional problem studied via the method, to-date. We evaluate our method on several benchmark tasks, including Safety Gym and Learn-to-Race (L2R), a recently-released high-fidelity autonomous racing environment. Our approach has significantly fewer constraint violations in comparison to other constrained RL baselines in Safety Gym, and achieves the new state-of-the-art results on the L2R benchmark task.

Abstract: Recent developments in pre-trained neural language modeling have led to leaps in accuracy on common-sense question-answering benchmarks. However, there is increasing concern that models overfit to specific tasks, without learning to utilize external knowledge or perform general semantic reasoning. In contrast, zero-shot evaluations have shown promise as a more robust measure of a model’s general reasoning abilities. In this paper, we propose a novel neuro-symbolic framework for zero-shot question answering across commonsense tasks. Guided by a set of hypotheses, the framework studies how to transform various pre-existing knowledge resources into a form that is most effective for pre-training models. We vary the set of language models, training regimes, knowledge sources, and data generation strategies, and measure their impact across tasks. Extending on prior work, we devise and compare four constrained distractor-sampling strategies. We provide empirical results across five commonsense question-answering tasks with data generated from five external knowledge resources. We show that, while an individual knowledge graph is better suited for specific tasks, a global knowledge graph brings consistent gains across different tasks. In addition, both preserving the structure of the task as well as generating fair and informative questions help language models learn more effectively.
- Leonid Boytsov, Eric Nyberg. 2020. Flexible retrieval with NMSLIB and FlexNeuART. Abstract: Our objective is to introduce to the NLP community NMSLIB, describe a new retrieval toolkit FlexNeuART, as well as their integration capabilities. NMSLIB, while being one the fastest k-NN search libraries, is quite generic and supports a variety of distance/similarity functions. Because the library relies on the distance-based structure-agnostic algorithms, it can be further extended by adding new distances. FlexNeuART is a modular, extendible and flexible toolkit for candidate generation in IR and QA applications, which supports mixing of classic and neural ranking signals. FlexNeuART can efficiently retrieve mixed dense and sparse representations (with weights learned from training data), which is achieved by extending NMSLIB. In that, other retrieval systems work with purely sparse representations (e.g., Lucene), purely dense representations (e.g., FAISS and Annoy), or only perform mixing at the re-ranking stage.

Lexically-constrained Text Generation through Commonsense Knowledge Extraction and Injection. Abstract: Conditional text generation has been a challenging task that is yet to see human-level performance from state-of-the-art models. In this work, we specifically focus on the Commongen benchmark, wherein the aim is to generate a plausible sentence for a given set of input concepts. Despite advances in other tasks, large pre-trained language models that are fine-tuned on this dataset often produce sentences that are syntactically correct but qualitatively deviate from a human understanding of common sense. Furthermore, generated sequences are unable to fulfill such lexical requirements as matching part-of-speech and full concept coverage. In this paper, we explore how commonsense knowledge graphs can enhance model performance, with respect to commonsense reasoning and lexically-constrained decoding. We propose strategies for enhancing the semantic correctness of the generated text, which we accomplish through: extracting commonsense relations from Conceptnet, injecting these relations into the Unified Language Model (UniLM) through attention mechanisms, and enforcing the aforementioned lexical requirements through output constraints. By performing several ablations, we find that commonsense injection enables the generation of sentences that are more aligned with human understanding, while remaining compliant with lexical requirements.

Abstract: In this paper we present our submission to the INTERSPEECH 2019 ComParE Sleepiness challenge. By nature, the given speech dataset is an archetype of one with relatively limited samples, a complex underlying data distribution, and subjective ordinal labels. We propose a novel approach termed ordinal triplet loss (OTL) that can be readily added to any deep architecture in order to address the above data constraints. Ordinal triplet loss implicitly maps inputs into a space where similar samples are closer to each other than different ones. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach on the aforementioned task.

Abstract: In this paper we study the task of creating questions to populate the knowledge base of a domain-oriented conversational agent, constituted of question-answer pairs. Considering the growing interest in Question Generation, a question arises: how good are current systems in the task of automatically populating an agent's knowledge base? In this study, three systems are evaluated in several dimensions specifically tailored for the task in hand. We evaluate not only the capacity of these systems to create questions close to the ones suggested by humans, but also the human effort in editing the set of generated questions to be ready to be added to the agent's knowledge base. This experiment leads us to a second question: does the set of automatically generated question complement/extend the questions generated by humans? Results show that these state-of-the-art Question Generation systems, even as a whole, are far from being able to generate the majority of the questions proposed by humans (up to 20% of coverage), and that, on average, several edits are needed (around 3) to correct the generated questions. However, on the other hand, these systems also contribute with questions that humans have not thought about, thus contributing to extend the pool of questions generated by humans.

Pentagon at MEDIQA 2019: Multi-task Learning for Filtering and Re-ranking Answers using Language Inference and Question Entailment. Abstract: Parallel deep learning architectures like fine-tuned BERT and MT-DNN, have quickly become the state of the art, bypassing previous deep and shallow learning methods by a large margin. More recently, pre-trained models from large related datasets have been able to perform well on many downstream tasks by just fine-tuning on domain-specific datasets (similar to transfer learning). However, using powerful models on non-trivial tasks, such as ranking and large document classification, still remains a challenge due to input size limitations of parallel architecture and extremely small datasets (insufficient for fine-tuning). In this work, we introduce an end-to-end system, trained in a multi-task setting, to filter and re-rank answers in the medical domain. We use task-specific pre-trained models as deep feature extractors. Our model achieves the highest Spearman’s Rho and Mean Reciprocal Rank of 0.338 and 0.9622 respectively, on the ACL-BioNLP workshop MediQA Question Answering shared-task.

Abstract: Information need of humans is essentially multimodal in nature, enabling maximum exploitation of situated context. We introduce a dataset for sequential procedural (how-to) text generation from images in cooking domain. The dataset consists of 16,441 cooking recipes with 160,479 photos associated with different steps. We setup a baseline motivated by the best performing model in terms of human evaluation for the Visual Story Telling (ViST) task. In addition, we introduce two models to incorporate high level structure learnt by a Finite State Machine (FSM) in neural sequential generation process by: (1) Scaffolding Structure in Decoder (SSiD) (2) Scaffolding Structure in Loss (SSiL). Our best performing model (SSiL) achieves a METEOR score of 0.31, which is an improvement of 0.6 over the baseline model. We also conducted human evaluation of the generated grounded recipes, which reveal that 61% found that our proposed (SSiL) model is better than the baseline model in terms of overall recipes. We also discuss analysis of the output highlighting key important NLP issues for prospective directions.

Abstract: mHealth is becoming increasingly data-driven in healthcare professions. Clinicians use a variety of data collection methods to capture the language use and communication performance of clients with complex communication needs. One solution for collecting and analyzing augmentative and alternative communication (AAC) data is through automatic data logging from high-tech AAC devices, also known as speech generating devices (SGDs). However, there is no interoperable method to analyze data logs across various SGDs. To address this, our work presents an interoperable data log format and a parser as a prototype solution. The prototype was used successfully to analyze two common AAC data log formats, and can easily be extended to other formats. This approach has significant potential to improve AAC outcome measurement for individual users, as well as comparison of outcomes across multiple users and devices.
- Kaixin Ma, Jonathan M Francis, Quanyang Lu, Eric Nyberg, A. Oltramari. 2019. Towards Generalizable Neuro-Symbolic Systems for Commonsense Question Answering. Abstract: Non-extractive commonsense QA remains a challenging AI task, as it requires systems to reason about, synthesize, and gather disparate pieces of information, in order to generate responses to queries. Recent approaches on such tasks show increased performance, only when models are either pre-trained with additional information or when domain-specific heuristics are used, without any special consideration regarding the knowledge resource type. In this paper, we perform a survey of recent commonsense QA methods and we provide a systematic analysis of popular knowledge resources and knowledge-integration methods, across benchmarks from multiple commonsense datasets. Our results and analysis show that attention-based injection seems to be a preferable choice for knowledge integration and that the degree of domain overlap, between knowledge bases and datasets, plays a crucial role in determining model success.

Abstract: This paper presents a multi-task learning approach to natural language inference (NLI) and question entailment (RQE) in the biomedical domain. Recognizing textual inference relations and question similarity can address the issue of answering new consumer health questions by mapping them to Frequently Asked Questions on reputed websites like the NIH. We show that leveraging information from parallel tasks across domains along with medical knowledge integration allows our model to learn better biomedical feature representations.

Abstract: Recognizing paralinguistic cues from speech has applications in varied domains of speech processing. In this paper we present approaches to identify the expressed intent from acoustics in the context of INTERSPEECH 2018 ComParE challenge. We have made submissions in three sub-challenges: prediction of 1) self-assessed affect and 2) atypical affect 3) Crying Sub challenge. Since emotion and intent are perceived at suprasegmental levels, we explore a variety of utterance level embeddings. The work includes experiments with both automatically derived as well as knowledge-inspired features that capture spoken intent at various acoustic levels. Incorporation of utterance level embeddings at the text level using an off the shelf phone decoder has also been investigated. The experiments impose constraints and manipulate the training procedure using heuristics from the data distribution. We conclude by presenting the preliminary results on the development and blind test sets.

Abstract: The task of Question Answering has gained prominence in the past few decades for testing the ability of machines to understand natural language. Large datasets for Machine Reading have led to the development of neural models that cater to deeper language understanding compared to information retrieval tasks. Different components in these neural architectures are intended to tackle different challenges. As a first step towards achieving generalization across multiple domains, we attempt to understand and compare the peculiarities of existing end-to-end neural models on the Stanford Question Answering Dataset (SQuAD) by performing quantitative as well as qualitative analysis of the results attained by each of them. We observed that prediction errors reflect certain model-specific biases, which we further discuss in this paper.

Ontology-Based Retrieval & Neural Approaches for BioASQ Ideal Answer Generation. Abstract: The ever-increasing magnitude of biomedical information sources makes it difficult and time-consuming for a human researcher to find the most relevant documents and pinpointed answers for a specific question or topic when using only a traditional search engine. Biomedical Question Answering systems automatically identify the most relevant documents and pinpointed answers, given an information need expressed as a natural language question. Generating a non-redundant, human-readable summary that satisfies the information need of a given biomedical question is the focus of the Ideal Answer Generation task, part of the BioASQ challenge. This paper presents a system for ideal answer generation (using ontology-based retrieval and a neural learning-to-rank approach, combined with extractive and abstractive summarization techniques) which achieved the highest ROUGE score of 0.659 on the BioASQ 5b batch 2 test.

Code-Mixed Question Answering Challenge: Crowd-sourcing Data and Techniques. Abstract: Code-Mixing (CM) is the phenomenon of alternating between two or more languages which is prevalent in bi- and multi-lingual communities. Most NLP applications today are still designed with the assumption of a single interaction language and are most likely to break given a CM utterance with multiple languages mixed at a morphological, phrase or sentence level. For example, popular commercial search engines do not yet fully understand the intents expressed in CM queries. As a first step towards fostering research which supports CM in NLP applications, we systematically crowd-sourced and curated an evaluation dataset for factoid question answering in three CM languages - Hinglish (Hindi+English), Tenglish (Telugu+English) and Tamlish (Tamil+English) which belong to two language families (Indo-Aryan and Dravidian). We share the details of our data collection process, techniques which were used to avoid inducing lexical bias amongst the crowd workers and other CM specific linguistic properties of the dataset. Our final dataset, which is available freely for research purposes, has 1,694 Hinglish, 2,848 Tamlish and 1,391 Tenglish factoid questions and their answers. We discuss the techniques used by the participants for the first edition of this ongoing challenge.
- Yutong Li, N. Gekakis, Qi Wu, B. Li, Khyathi Raghavi Chandu, Eric Nyberg. 2018. Extraction Meets Abstraction: Ideal Answer Generation for Biomedical Questions. Abstract: The growing number of biomedical publications is a challenge for human researchers, who invest considerable effort to search for relevant documents and pinpointed answers. Biomedical Question Answering can automatically generate answers for a user’s topic or question, significantly reducing the effort required to locate the most relevant information in a large document corpus. Extractive summarization techniques, which concatenate the most relevant text units drawn from multiple documents, perform well on automatic evaluation metrics like ROUGE, but score poorly on human readability, due to the presence of redundant text and grammatical errors in the answer. This work moves toward abstractive summarization, which attempts to distill and present the meaning of the original text in a more coherent way. We incorporate a sentence fusion approach, based on Integer Linear Programming, along with three novel approaches for sentence ordering, in an attempt to improve the human readability of ideal answers. Using an open framework for configuration space exploration (BOOM), we tested over 2000 unique system configurations in order to identify the best-performing combinations for the sixth edition of Phase B of the BioASQ challenge.

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the tendency of end-to-end neural Machine Reading Comprehension (MRC) models to match shallow patterns rather than perform inference-oriented reasoning on RC benchmarks. We aim to test the ability of these systems to answer questions which focus on referential inference. We propose ParallelQA, a strategy to formulate such questions using parallel passages. We also demonstrate that existing neural models fail to generalize well to this setting.

Abstract: In this paper, we present a novel Biomedical Question Answering system, BioAMA: “Biomedical Ask Me Anything” on task 5b of the annual BioASQ challenge. In this work, we focus on a wide variety of question types including factoid, list based, summary and yes/no type questions that generate both exact and well-formed ‘ideal’ answers. For summary-type questions, we combine effective IR-based techniques for retrieval and diversification of relevant snippets for a question to create an end-to-end system which achieves a ROUGE-2 score of 0.72 and a ROUGE-SU4 score of 0.71 on ideal answer questions (7% improvement over the previous best model). Additionally, we propose a novel NLI-based framework to answer the yes/no questions. To train the NLI model, we also devise a transfer-learning technique by cross-domain projection of word embeddings. Finally, we present a two-stage approach to address the factoid and list type questions by first generating a candidate set using NER taggers and ranking them using both supervised or unsupervised techniques.
- Di Wang, N. Jojic, Chris Brockett, Eric Nyberg. 2017. Steering Output Style and Topic in Neural Response Generation. Abstract: We propose simple and flexible training and decoding methods for influencing output style and topic in neural encoder-decoder based language generation. This capability is desirable in a variety of applications, including conversational systems, where successful agents need to produce language in a specific style and generate responses steered by a human puppeteer or external knowledge. We decompose the neural generation process into empirically easier sub-problems: a faithfulness model and a decoding method based on selective-sampling. We also describe training and sampling algorithms that bias the generation process with a specific language style restriction, or a topic restriction. Human evaluation results show that our proposed methods are able to to restrict style and topic without degrading output quality in conversational tasks.

Abstract: In this paper, we describe our participation in phase B of task 5b of the fifth edition of the annual BioASQ challenge, which includes answering factoid, list, yes-no and summary questions from biomedical data. We describe our techniques with an emphasis on ideal answer generation, where the goal is to produce a relevant, precise, non-redundant, query-oriented summary from multiple relevant documents. We make use of extractive summarization techniques to address this task and experiment with different biomedical ontologies and various algorithms including agglomerative clustering, Maximum Marginal Relevance (MMR) and sentence compression. We propose a novel word embedding based tf-idf similarity metric and a soft positional constraint which improve our system performance. We evaluate our techniques on test batch 4 from the fourth edition of the challenge. Our best system achieves a ROUGE-2 score of 0.6534 and ROUGE-SU4 score of 0.6536.

Abstract: We developed a faculty professional development seminar series in order to facilitate the integration of our numerous new faculty into academics. The changing nature of the healthcare system, increasing clinical and administrative responsibility, and lack of access to senior mentors can hinder junior faculty productivity and possibly increase attrition. Given that no ready-made resources existed to address these issues we established a Professional Development Committee, developed a curriculum that covers relevant topics including promotion, mentorship, conflict management and feedback, and effective presentation of scientific data, and instituted changes iteratively based upon feedback. We used surveys from successive years of this seminar series to assess effectiveness, and our data demonstrate that our Professional Development Seminar Series was valued by its participants and that individual lectures improved from year to year. While it is too early to determine whether our efforts will lead to long-term changes in promotion success or faculty retention, our initial data are promising.
- Varun Gangal, Harsh Jhamtani, Graham Neubig, E. Hovy, Eric Nyberg. 2017. Charmanteau: Character Embedding Models For Portmanteau Creation. Abstract: Portmanteaus are a word formation phenomenon where two words combine into a new word. We propose character-level neural sequence-to-sequence (S2S) methods for the task of portmanteau generation that are end-to-end-trainable, language independent, and do not explicitly use additional phonetic information. We propose a noisy-channel-style model, which allows for the incorporation of unsupervised word lists, improving performance over a standard source-to-target model. This model is made possible by an exhaustive candidate generation strategy specifically enabled by the features of the portmanteau task. Experiments find our approach superior to a state-of-the-art FST-based baseline with respect to ground truth accuracy and human evaluation.

Abstract: Variations in writing styles are commonly used to adapt the content to a specific context, audience, or purpose. However, applying stylistic variations is still by and large a manual process, and there have been little efforts towards automating it. In this paper we explore automated methods to transform text from modern English to Shakespearean English using an end to end trainable neural model with pointers to enable copy action. To tackle limited amount of parallel data, we pre-train embeddings of words by leveraging external dictionaries mapping Shakespearean words to modern English words as well as additional text. Our methods are able to get a BLEU score of 31+, an improvement of ≈ 6 points above the strongest baseline. We publicly release our code to foster further research in this area.

Abstract: In this paper, we present CMU’s question answering system that was evaluated in the TREC 2017 LiveQA Challenge. Our overall approach this year is similar to the one used in 2015 and 2016. This system answers real-user submitted questions from Yahoo! Answers website and medical questions, which involves retrieving relevant web pages, extracting answer candidate texts, ranking and selecting final answer text. The main improvement this year is the introduction of our new question paraphrase identification module based on a neural dual entailment model. The model uses bidirectional recurrent neural network to encode the premise question into phrase vectors, and then align corresponding phrase vectors from the candidate question with the attention mechanism. The final similarity score is produced based on aggregated phrase-wise comparisons of both entailment directions. In the TREC 2017 LiveQA evaluations, human assessors gave our system an average score of 1.139 on a three-point scale and the median score was 0.777 for all the systems evaluated. Overall, our approach received the highest average scores among automatic systems in main tasks of 2015, 2016 and 2017, and also the highest average score in the new medical subtask of 2017.

Eliciting Lexically Diverse Dialogue for Supervised Semantic Parsing. Abstract: Building dialogue interfaces for real-world scenarios often entails training semantic parsers starting from zero examples. How can we build datasets that better capture the variety of ways users might phrase their queries, and what queries are actually realistic? Wang et al. (2015) proposed a method to build semantic parsing datasets by generating canonical utterances using a grammar and having crowdworkers paraphrase them into natural wording. A limitation of this approach is that it induces bias towards using similar language as the canonical utterances. In this work, we present a methodology that elicits meaningful and lexically diverse queries from users for semantic parsing tasks. Starting from a seed lexicon and a generative grammar, we pair logical forms with mixed text-image representations and ask crowdworkers to paraphrase and confirm the plausibility of the queries that they generated. We use this method to build a semantic parsing dataset from scratch for a dialog agent in a smart-home simulation. We find evidence that this dataset, which we have named SmartHome, is demonstrably more lexically diverse and difficult to parse than existing domain-specific semantic parsing datasets.

Abstract: Deep neural networks for machine comprehension typically utilizes only word or character embeddings without explicitly taking advantage of structured linguistic information such as constituency trees and dependency trees. In this paper, we propose structural embedding of syntactic trees (SEST), an algorithm framework to utilize structured information and encode them into vector representations that can boost the performance of algorithms for the machine comprehension. We evaluate our approach using a state-of-the-art neural attention model on the SQuAD dataset. Experimental results demonstrate that our model can accurately identify the syntactic boundaries of the sentences and extract answers that are syntactically coherent over the baseline methods.

Abstract: In this paper, we present CMU’s question answering system that was evaluated in the TREC 2016 LiveQA Challenge. Our overall approach this year is similar to the one used in 2015. This system answers real-user submitted questions from Yahoo! Answers website, which involves retrieving relevant web pages, extracting answer candidate texts, ranking and selecting answer candidates. The main improvement this year is the introduction of a novel answer passage ranking method based on attentional encoder-decoder recurrent neural networks (RNN). Our method uses one RNN to encode candidate answer passage into vectors, and then another RNN to decode the input question from the vectors. The perplexity of decoding the question is then used as the ranking score. In the TREC 2016 LiveQA evaluations, human assessors gave our system an average score of 1.1547 on a three-point scale and the average score was .5766 for all the 26 systems evaluated.

- Leonid Boytsov, David Novak, Yury Malkov, Eric Nyberg. 2016. Off the Beaten Path: Let's Replace Term-Based Retrieval with k-NN Search. Abstract: Retrieval pipelines commonly rely on a term-based search to obtain candidate records, which are subsequently re-ranked. Some candidates are missed by this approach, e.g., due to a vocabulary mismatch. We address this issue by replacing the term-based search with a generic k-NN retrieval algorithm, where a similarity function can take into account subtle term associations. While an exact brute-force k-NN search using this similarity function is slow, we demonstrate that an approximate algorithm can be nearly two orders of magnitude faster at the expense of only a small loss in accuracy. A retrieval pipeline using an approximate k-NN search can be more effective and efficient than the term-based pipeline. This opens up new possibilities for designing effective retrieval pipelines. Our software (including data-generating code) and derivative data based on the Stack Overflow collection is available online.

Abstract: This paper describes the CMU OAQA system evaluated in the BioASQ 3B Question Answering track. We first present a three-layered architecture, and then describe the components integrated for exact answer generation and retrieval. Using over 400 factoid and list questions from past BioASQ 1B and 2B tasks as background knowledge, we focus on how to learn to answer questions using a gold standard dataset of question-answer pairs, using supervised models for answer type prediction and candidate answer scoring. On the three test sets where the system was evaluated (3, 4, and 5), the official evaluation results have shown that the system achieves an MRR of .1615, .5155, .2727 for factoid questions, and an F-measure of .0969, .3168, .1875 for list questions, respectively; five of these scores were the highest reported among all participating systems.

Abstract: CMU OAQA team participated in the Task Understanding subtask in the Tasks track, and submitted three runs rsf, lsf, and lsfs for official evaluation. In our earlier work [1], we proposed to leverage procedural knowledge (e.g. wikiHow or eHow) for task-oriented search problems including query suggestion, which is similar to the goal of this Task Understanding task. Therefore, we reused the same system1, the wikiHow corpus2, and the pretrained model to generate key phrases for the 50 sample queries. Since our approach entirely relies on a procedural knowledge base, the freebaseID fields in the given input file were not used in our system, although ambiguity might become an issue in some cases. We intend to take the advantage of the TREC evaluation to test if our hypotheses that were stated in our earlier work still hold:
- Bilegsaikhan Naidan, Leonid Boytsov, Eric Nyberg. 2015. Permutation Search Methods are Efficient, Yet Faster Search is Possible. Abstract: We survey permutation-based methods for approximate k-nearest neighbor search. In these methods, every data point is represented by a ranked list of pivots sorted by the distance to this point. Such ranked lists are called permutations. The underpinning assumption is that, for both metric and non-metric spaces, the distance between permutations is a good proxy for the distance between original points. Thus, it should be possible to efficiently retrieve most true nearest neighbors by examining only a tiny subset of data points whose permutations are similar to the permutation of a query. We further test this assumption by carrying out an extensive experimental evaluation where permutation methods are pitted against state-of-the art benchmarks (the multi-probe LSH, the VP-tree, and proximity-graph based retrieval) on a variety of realistically large data set from the image and textual domain. The focus is on the high-accuracy retrieval methods for generic spaces. Additionally, we assume that both data and indices are stored in main memory. We find permutation methods to be reasonably efficient and describe a setup where these methods are most useful. To ease reproducibility, we make our software and data sets publicly available.
- Di Wang, Eric Nyberg. 2015. A Long Short-Term Memory Model for Answer Sentence Selection in Question Answering. Abstract: In this paper, we present an approach that address the answer sentence selection problem for question answering. The proposed method uses a stacked bidirectional Long-Short Term Memory (BLSTM) network to sequentially read words from question and answer sentences, and then outputs their relevance scores. Unlike prior work, this approach does not require any syntactic parsing or external knowledge resources such as WordNet which may not be available in some domains or languages. The full system is based on a combination of the stacked BLSTM relevance model and keywords matching. The results of our experiments on a public benchmark dataset from TREC show that our system outperforms previous work which requires syntactic features and external knowledge resources.
- Zi Yang, Eric Nyberg. 2015. Leveraging Procedural Knowledge for Task-oriented Search. Abstract: Many search engine users attempt to satisfy an information need by issuing multiple queries, with the expectation that each result will contribute some portion of the required information. Previous research has shown that structured or semi-structured descriptive knowledge bases (such as Wikipedia) can be used to improve search quality and experience for general or entity-centric queries. However, such resources do not have sufficient coverage of procedural knowledge, i.e. what actions should be performed and what factors should be considered to achieve some goal; such procedural knowledge is crucial when responding to task-oriented search queries. This paper provides a first attempt to bridge the gap between two evolving research areas: development of procedural knowledge bases (such as wikiHow) and task-oriented search. We investigate whether task-oriented search can benefit from existing procedural knowledge (search task suggestion) and whether automatic procedural knowledge construction can benefit from users' search activities (automatic procedural knowledge base construction). We propose to create a three-way parallel corpus of queries, query contexts, and task descriptions, and reduce both problems to sequence labeling tasks. We propose a set of textual features and structural features to identify key search phrases from task descriptions, and then adapt similar features to extract wikiHow-style procedural knowledge descriptions from search queries and relevant text snippets. We compare our proposed solution with baseline algorithms, commercial search engines, and the (manually-curated) wikiHow procedural knowledge; experimental results show an improvement of +0.28 to +0.41 in terms of Precision@8 and mean average precision (MAP).

Introducing LUIMA: an experiment in legal conceptual retrieval of vaccine injury decisions using a UIMA type system and tools. Abstract: This paper presents first results from a proof of feasibility experiment in conceptual legal document retrieval in a particular domain (involving vaccine injury compensation). The conceptual markup of documents is done automatically using LUIMA, a law-specific semantic extraction toolbox based on the UIMA framework. The system consists of modules for automatic sub-sentence level annotation, machine learning based sentence annotation, basic retrieval using Apache Lucene and a machine learning based reranking of retrieved documents. In a leave-one-out experiment on a limited corpus, the resulting rankings scored higher for most tested queries than baseline rankings created using a commercial full-text legal information system.

Abstract: Abstract : In this paper, we present CMUs automatic, web-based, real-time question answering (QA) system that was evaluated in the TREC 2015 LiveQA Challenge.This system answers real-user questions freshly submitted to the Yahoo! Answers website that have not been previously answered by humans. Given the title and body of the question, we generated multiple sets of keyword queries and retrieved a collection of web pages based on those queries. Then we extracted answer candidates from web pages in the form of answer passages and their associated clue. Finally, we combined both IR- and NLP-based relevance models to rank and select answer candidates. In the TREC 2015 LiveQA evaluations, human assessors gave our system an average score of 1.081 on a three-point scale, the highest average score achieved by a system in the competition (the second-best score was .677, and the average score was .465 for the 21 systems evaluated).

- Zi Yang, Ying Li, James Cai, Eric Nyberg. 2014. QUADS: question answering for decision support. Abstract: As the scale of available on-line data grows ever larger, individuals and businesses must cope with increasing complexity in decision-making processes which utilize large volumes of unstructured, semi-structured and/or structured data to satisfy multiple, interrelated information needs which contribute to an overall decision. Traditional decision support systems (DSSs) have been developed to address this need, but such systems are typically expensive to build, and are purpose-built for a particular decision-making scenario, making them difficult to extend or adapt to new decision scenarios. In this paper, we propose a novel decision representation which allows decision makers to formulate and organize natural language questions or assertions into an analytic hierarchy, which can be evaluated as part of an ad hoc decision process or as a documented, repeatable analytic process. We then introduce a new decision support framework, QUADS, which takes advantage of automatic question answering (QA) technologies to automatically understand and process a decision representation, producing a final decision by gathering and weighting answers to individual questions using a Bayesian learning and inference process. An open source framework implementation is presented and applied to two real world applications: target validation, a fundamental decision-making task for the pharmaceutical industry, and product recommendation from review texts, an everyday decision-making situation faced by on-line consumers. In both applications, we implemented and compared a number of decision synthesis algorithms, and present experimental results which demonstrate the performance of the QUADS approach versus other baseline approaches.

Abstract: We describe CMU’s UIMA-based modular automatic question answering (QA) system. This system answers multiplechoice English questions for the world history entrance exam. Questions are preceded by short descriptions providing a historical context. Given the context and question-specic instructions, we generate veriable assertions for each answer choice. These assertions are evaluated using several evidencing modules, which assign a plausibility score to each assertion. These scores are then aggregated to produce the most plausible answer choice. In the NTCIR-11 QALab evaluations, our system achieved 51.6% accuracy on the training set, 47.2% on Phase 1 testing set, and 34.1% on Phase 2 testing set.

Abstract: Objective Carotid stenosis in the setting of anterior circulation embolic disease poses significant difficulties due to the complex nature of endovascular repair. There is ongoing debate about the benefits of initially treating distally versus proximally. However, the best method of treating proximal disease remains ambiguous. While stenting may lead to better long-term patency, this approach requires antiplatelet therapy, possibly increasing the risk of haemorrhage. At our center, a modified Dotter technique has been used in lieu of primary stenting in this setting. Using this technique for the treatment of carotid stenosis in the acute stroke setting can eliminate the need for antiplatelet therapy, reduce procedure times, and possibly reduce haemorrhagic conversion rates. Methods The Dotter Stroke technique is a previously unreported method for treating carotid stenosis in the acute stroke setting. First, a wire and guiding catheter or dilator are advanced across the stenosis, followed by a guiding sheath. While removing the dilator and wire, vigorous aspiration is performed. The sheath is left across the stenosis and connected to a pressurised drip. Then, intracranial thrombectomy is performed according to operator preference. After intracranial embolectomy is complete, the sheath is backed into the common carotid artery under aspiration. Repeat angiography is performed, and final stenosis is measured. Delayed angiography is performed to assure short-term patency. From April 2013–January 2014, seven patients were identified with atherosclerotic stenosis at the carotid origin >50% and ipsilateral intracranial emboli, who presented with acute stroke and were treated using the Dotter Stroke technique. Modified Rankin and NIH Stroke scales, as well as clinical and procedural times where recorded. Pre and Post-Dotter stenosis were measured using the NASCET criteria. The final angiograms and long term non-invasive imaging were evaluated for dissection, haemorrhage, restenosis, and reintervention. Results The mean age was 64 years, and mean initial NIHSS was 11.7. The mean time from clinical onset to recanalization was 4 h and 5 min, with average groin to recanalization times of 26 min (14–40). TICI 2b or greater flow was achieved in all patients. The mean stenosis was 88% pre-operatively (65%–100%). After removing the sheath from ICA, post-Dotter stenosis was 61% (33%–78%). In the two subjects with the highest post-Dotter stenosis (76% and 78%), rapid re-occlusion was noted. One of these subjects had a flow limiting dissection; both were treated with bailout stenting. The remaining subjects has a post-Dotter stenosis between 33% and 65%, without re-occlusion. Average follow up is 150 days, with no haemorrhage or restenosis in any subject. There was one death in a patient with initial NIHSS of 25. The reminder had modified Rankin scales of 0 at follow-up. Conclusion The Dotter Stroke technique is a safe alternative to carotid stenting, and may be useful in patients at increased risk for haemorrhage. In this small series, a post-Dotter stenosis >75% is associated with re-occlusion, and stenting should be performed to prevent re-occlusion. No re-occlusion was identified at 30 days with post-Dotter stenosis <= 65%. Disclosures B. Woodward: None. E. Nyberg: None. S. Wegryn: None.

Traditionally, this includes major costs in terms of personnel and resources, but also in terms of collateral costs such as disruptions in traffic and the urban surroundings. By restoring the old pipes, instead of replacing them, the network owners hope to be able to carry out the renewal of the network pipes faster, at reduced costs and with less damage to the environment.Relining is pipe renewal. Relining has been used when restoring sewage pipes for several decades and, for the last twenty years, also when restoring drinking water pipes. Until now, district heating pipes have not been subject to relining. District heating pipes, unlike sewage pipes, are exposed to tough conditions in terms of both pressure and temperature. The conditions in the district heating pipe system and the limitations in the available materials have until now hindered the market for restoring these pipes. During 2013, a study was conducted on relining with a composition of modern plastics and fiber materials. The outcome of that study was that relining companies as well as potential customers noted that modern techniques and materials have the potential of managing the changes in temperature and pressure that the pipes in the district heating system are exposed to.There are still several unanalyzed aspects of restoring district heating pipes. Because of the lack of commercial products in the field, multiple parameters are missing for calculating the profitability of investments in pipe renewal through relining. One of the aspects is the potential differences in heat loss between relined old pipes and new modern pipes. These differences may affect the variable costs for the distributors of district heating.This study aims to present an estimate of the magnitude of the differences in heat loss caused by relining as a substitute to replacement of old pipes. The heat loss was calculated for a case study with multiple cases, where different circumstances apply in the system.The study concludes that the heat loss from relined pipes may be prominently larger in cases where the insulating materials around the pipe have degenerated. If the insulation consists of wet mineral wool, there is a risk of doubling the heat loss from a relined pipe in comparison with the heat loss from a new pipe. Also, the calculations show that relining of pipes, embedded in an undamaged culvert, contribute very small differences in the heat loss. The condition of the pipe network should be subject to consideration when making investment calculations for renewal of the district heating system.Insufficient knowledge of the condition of the pipes may lead to application of a lesser method for renewal of the system. In terms of heat loss, it may cause major costs for distributors of district heating.

Abstract: We show that it is possible to reliably discriminate whether a syntactic construction is meant literally or metaphorically using lexical semantic features of the words that participate in the construction. Our model is constructed using English resources, and we obtain state-of-the-art performance relative to previous work in this language. Using a model transfer approach by pivoting through a bilingual dictionary, we show our model can identify metaphoric expressions in other languages. We provide results on three new test sets in Spanish, Farsi, and Russian. The results support the hypothesis that metaphors are conceptual, rather than lexical, in nature.

The final section (SED) describes our approaches and results on the Surveillance Event Detection task. Abstract We report on our system used in the TRECVID 2013 Multimedia Event Detection (MED) and Multimedia Event Recounting (MER) tasks. For MED, it consists of four main steps: extracting features, representing features, training detectors and fusion. In the feature extraction part, we extract more than 10 low-level, high-level, and text features. Those features are then represented in three different ways which are spatial bag-of words, Gaussian Mixture Model Super Vectors (GMM) and Fisher Vectors. In the detector training and fusion, two classifiers and weighted double fusion method are employed. The official evaluation results show that our MED full systems achieve the best scores on Ah-Hoc EK10 and EK0, our audio systems achieve the best scores in EK100 and EK10 for both Pre-specified and Ad-Hoc tasks. Our MER system utilizes a subset of features and detection results from the MED system from which the recounting is generated.

Abstract: Different software systems for automatic question answering have been developed in recent years. Some systems perform well on specific domains, but may not be appropriate for other domains. As the complexity and scaling of such information systems become ever greater, it is much more challenging to effectively and efficiently determine which toolkits, algorithms, knowledge bases or other resources should be integrated into a system so that one can achieve a desired or optimal level of performance on a given task. In this working notepaper, we present a generic framework that can be used for any machinereading task and automatically find the best configuration of algorithmic components as well as values of their corresponding parameters. Although we have designed the framework for all QA4MRE-2013 tasks (i.e. Main task, Biomedical about Alzheimer’s and Entrance Exam), our analysis will mostly focus on Biomedical about Alzheimer’s task. We introduce the Configuration Space Exploration (CSE) framework, an extension to the Unstructured Information Management Architecture (UIMA) which provides a general distributed solution for building and exploring possible configurations for any intelligent information system. For the Biomedial about Alzheimer’s task, CSE was used to generate more than 1000 different configurations from existing components; we selected the 3 best runs for submission. We achieved an average c@1 of 0.27; our highest score was 0.60 for reading-test-1, and our lowest was 0.0 for reading-test3. We further enhanced the system by introducing point-wise mutual information (PMI) scoring for answer ranking, which produced an average c@1 of 0.4025, with a highest score of 0.77 for reading test-1 and a lowest score of 0.2 for reading test-2.
- R. Liu, Eric Nyberg. 2013. A phased ranking model for question answering. Abstract: We describe a general result ranking approach for multi-phase, multi strategy information systems, which has been applied to the task of question answering (QA). Many information systems incorporate multiple steps and each step or phase may incorporate multiple component algorithms to achieve acceptable robustness and overall performance. Such systems may produce and rank a large number of candidate results. Prior work includes many models that rank a particular type of information object (e.g. a retrieved document, a factoid answer) using features specific to that information type, without attempting to make use of other non-local features (e.g. features of the upstream information source). We propose an approach that allows each phase in a system to leverage information propagated from preceding phases to inform the ranking decision. This is accomplished by a system object graph which represents all of the objects created during system execution, object dependencies (e.g. provenance), and ranking feature values extracted for a specific object. We evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed ranking approach in a multi-phase question answering system built by recombining pre-existing software modules. Experimental results show that our proposed approach significantly outperforms comparable answer ranking models.

Building optimal information systems automatically: configuration space exploration for biomedical information systems. Abstract: Software frameworks which support integration and scaling of text analysis algorithms make it possible to build complex, high performance information systems for information extraction, information retrieval, and question answering; IBM's Watson is a prominent example. As the complexity and scaling of information systems become ever greater, it is much more challenging to effectively and efficiently determine which toolkits, algorithms, knowledge bases or other resources should be integrated into an information system in order to achieve a desired or optimal level of performance on a given task. This paper presents a formal representation of the space of possible system configurations, given a set of information processing components and their parameters (configuration space) and discusses algorithmic approaches to determine the optimal configuration within a given configuration space (configuration space exploration or CSE). We introduce the CSE framework, an extension to the UIMA framework which provides a general distributed solution for building and exploring configuration spaces for information systems. The CSE framework was used to implement biomedical information systems in case studies involving over a trillion different configuration combinations of components and parameter values operating on question answering tasks from the TREC Genomics. The framework automatically and efficiently evaluated different system configurations, and identified configurations that achieved better results than prior published results.

P-013 Treatment of ruptured basilar artery pontine perforator aneurysm with neuroform stent monotherapy: a report of two cases. Abstract: Introduction Subarachnoid hemorrhages (SAH) are most commonly caused by trauma, ruptured cerebral aneurysm, and benign perimesencephalic hemorrhage. We report two cases of basal cistern SAH that were initially angiographically negative, however follow-up delayed angiography demonstrated an 2 mm aneurysm arising from a sub-millimeter pontine artery perforator, distinct from the basilar artery. In each case, treatment was placement of two overlapping Neuroform stents in the basilar artery. Case presentation A 46-year-old man presents with SAH centered in the pre-pontine cistern. Initial angiography was negative and the patient clinically did well, however subsequent angiography at 6 weeks demonstrated a 2 mm aneurysm arising from a pontine artery perforator. A 61-year-old female presented to with a SAH. Similarly, the initial angiography was negative, however subsequent angiography demonstrated a 2 mm aneurysm arising from a pontine artery perforator. Discussion In both cases, the patients' aneurysm originated from a small pontine artery perforator and the basilar artery was clearly distinct. In the first case (in 2006) had treatment options of observation, surgical exploration, or stenting of the basilar artery. The perforator was too small to catheterize with a microcatheter. Placement of overlapping Neuroform stents did not change aneurysm opacification initially, however at follow-up angiography, the aneurysm no longer opacified despite the artery being patent (Abstract P-013 figure 1A). The second case occurred in 2011, and therefore flow diversion with Pipeline was possible, however we chose to place overlapping Neuroform stents, which resulted aneurysm occlusion while maintaining vessel potency (Abstract P-013 figure 1B).Abstract P-013 Figure 1 Conclusion Aneurysms arising from a basilar artery perforator are extremely rare, however successful treatment is possible. Although we treated with conventional microstents, newer flow diversion devices also offer a reasonable treatment option. Competing interests R Turner: Microvention, Codman. ev3, Penumbra, Mindframe.

Abstract: Abstract Linear sebaceous nevus syndrome (LNSS) is a rare neurocutaneous disorder associated with mental retardation, linear sebaceous nevus of Jadassohn and seizures. Characterized by Feuerstein and Mims in 1962, this disorder has been, grouped with other epidermal nevus syndromes and the phakomatoses. Five distinct epidermal nevus syndromes have been described and characterized by their epidermal nevi and organ system involvement, particularly, brain, eyes and skeleton. LNSS has been associated with hemimegalencephaly and other non-LNSS forms of epidermal nevus syndromes have been associated with hemiatrophy. We present a case of LNSS with diagnostic dermatologic, pathologic and clinical findings but unique computerized tomography and magnetic resonance imaging findings: an undersized hemisphere, unusual draining veins, thinning of the left temporal and occipital cortices ipsilateral to the linear nevus and left frontal bone focal scalloping. We have not found the combination of a vascular anomaly and undersized hemisphere specifically described with LNSS, although a few cases of cerebrovascular abnormality have been associated with LNSS. We discuss the radiologic findings in context of known embryology to favor hemihypoplasia over hemiatrophy. We hope that this case report will lead to further investigations in the pathophysiology and genetics of this disorder.

Comparison of Brain MR Images at 1.5T Using BLADE and Rectilinear Techniques for Patients Who Move during Data Acquisition. Abstract: BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: MR imaging of moving patients can be challenging and motion correction techniques have been proposed though some have associated new artifacts. The objective of this study was to semiquantitatively compare brain MR images of moving patients obtained at 1.5T by using partially radial and rectilinear acquisition techniques. MATERIALS AND METHODS: FLAIR, T2-, T1-, and contrast-enhanced T1-weighted image sets of 25 patients (14–94 years) obtained by using BLADE (like PROPELLER, a partially radial acquisition) and rectilinear techniques in the same imaging session were compared by 2 neuroradiologists in terms of extent of the motion artifact, image quality, and lesion visibility. ICC between opinions of the evaluators was calculated. RESULTS: Of the total of 70 image sets, the motion artifact was small in the partially radial images in 43 and in the rectilinear images in 13, and the opinions of the evaluators were discordant in the remaining 14 sets (ICC = 0.63, P < .05). The quality of partially radial images was higher for 36 sets versus 9 rectilinear sets, with disagreement between the 2 evaluators in the remaining 25 (ICC = 0.15, P < .05). Pathologic lesions were better characterized on 37 sets of partially radial images versus 13 sets of rectilinear images, and opinions of the evaluators differed in 20 sets (ICC = 0.90, P < .05). The neuroradiologists deemed 4 sets of rectilinear images nondiagnostic compared with only 1 set of radial images. CONCLUSIONS: The data demonstrate that our application of BLADE sequences reduces the extent of motion artifacts in brain images of moving patients, improving image quality and lesion characterization.

Abstract: Introduction Surgical clipping of intracranial aneurysm can be complicated by clip encroachment of the parent artery. We present a case where symptomatic MCA stenosis occurring after clipping of a left carotid terminus aneurysm with reperfusion was restored using a Pipeline Embolization Device to buttress open the MCA. Case report A 61-year-old African American underwent an orbito-zygomatic craniotomy of multiple aneurysms, including a 15 mm left carotid terminus aneurysm. After clip placement the left carotid terminus, ACA, and MCA origins were widely patent with a 2 mm dog ear remnant along the MCA (top figure) Abstract P-0015 figure 1. The anterior dome of the aneurysm was incised and showed no filling of the aneurysm. There was no vascular kinking or compromise of flow in the carotid terminus or MCA measured by intra-operative Doppler. Post-operatively the patient's neurological exam declined to somnolence, confusion and right-sided hemiparesis. CT/CTA/CTP demonstrated patency of the left carotid terminus and MCA, a small infarct in the left lentiform nuclei, and markedly increased mean transit time in the left MCA territory with preservation of the cerebral blood volume. Diagnostic angiography demonstrated a critical narrowing of the carotid terminus and MCA origin with delayed flow through the left MCA territory (bottom left figure) Abstract P-015 figure 1. There was no filling of the aneurysm, including the dog ear remnant noted at surgery. A 3.0×18 mm PED was advanced across the narrowing and deployed followed by intra-device angioplasty. Post PED and angioplasty angiography demonstrated improved caliber of the narrowed segment with markedly improved perfusion of the MCA territory (bottom right figure). The aneurysm remained completely occluded.Abstract P-015 Figure 1 Discussion Arterial stenosis due to an aneurysm clip traditionally required surgical re-positioning of the aneurysm clip. Endovascular options are limited due to poor radial resistive forces of neurovascular nitinol stents. However, cobalt chromium has a higher specific modulus than nitinol that makes it an attractive high stiffness, low weight material. As such, Pipeline should have a steeper loading curve and corresponding radial resistive force, than nitinol stents. In addition, the static friction at the points of intersection of the braided tines may also provide additional resistance to deflection. Conclusion Successful restoration of flow using Pipeline was achieved without complication. Competing interests R Turner: Microvention, Codman. ev3, Penumbra, Mindframe. A Turk: None.

MED System 1.1 Features In order to encompass all aspects of a video, we extracted a wide variety of low-level and highlevel features. Table 1 summarizes the features used in our system. Among those features, most of them are widely used features in the community, for example, SIFT, STIP and MFCC. We extracted those features using standard code available from the authors with default parameters. Table 1: Features used for MED’12 system Visual Features Audio Features Low-level features 1.

Acoustic Scene Analysis Text Features 1. Optical Character Recognition 1. Automatic Speech Recognition Besides those common features, we have two home-grown features which are Motion SIFT (MoSIFT) and Acoustic Unit Descriptors (AUDs). We will introduce these two features in the following subsections. 1.1 .1 Motion SIFT (MoSIFT) Feature The goal of developing the MoSIFT feature is to combine the features from the spatial domain and the temporal domain. Local spatio-temporal features around interest points provide compact and descriptive representations for video analysis and motion recognition. Current approaches tend to extend spatial descriptions by adding a temporal component to the appearance descriptor, which only implicitly captures motion information. MoSIFT detects interest points and encodes not only their local appearance but also explicitly models local motion. The idea is to detect distinctive local features through local appearance and motion. Figure 1 demonstrates the MoSIFT algorithm. Figure 1: System flow chart of the MoSIFT algorithm. The algorithm takes a pair of video frames to find spatio-temporal interest points at multiple scales. Two major computations are applied: SIFT point detection and optical flow computation according to the scale of the SIFT points. For the descriptor, MoSIFT adapts the idea of grid aggregation in SIFT to describe motions. Optical flow detects the magnitude and direction of a movement. Thus, optical flow has the same properties as appearance gradients. The same aggregation can be applied to optical flow in the neighborhood of interest points to increase robustness to occlusion and deformation. The two aggregated histograms (appearance and optical flow) are combined into the MoSIFT descriptor, which now has 256 dimensions. 1.1 .2 Acoustic Unit Descriptors (AUDs) We have developed an unsupervised lexicon learning algorithm that automatically learns units of sound. Each unit is such that it spans a set of audio frames, thereby taking local acoustic context into account. Using a maximum-likelihood estimation process, we can learn a set of such acoustic units unsupervised from audio data. Each of these units can be thought of as low-level fundamental units of sound, and each audio frame is generated by these units. We refer to these units as Acoustic Unit Descriptors (AUDs) and we expect that the distribution of these units will carry information about the semantic content of the audio stream. Each AUD is represented by a 5-state Hidden Markov Model (HMM) with a 4-gaussian mixture output density function. Ideally, with a perfect learning process, we would like to learn semantically interpretable lowerlevel units, such as a clap, a thud sound, a bang, etc. Naturally, it is hard to enforce semantic interpretability on the audio learning process at that level of detail. Further, because the space of all possible sounds is so large, many different sounds will be mapped into single sounds at learning time, since we can only learn a finite set of units. 1.2 Feature Representat ions In the previous section, we briefly describe the features we used in the system. In this section, we will describe the representations we used for the raw features extracted in Section 1. Three representations were used in our system. They were K-means based spatial bag-ofwords model with standard tiling (Lazebnik, Schmid, & Ponce, 2006), K-means based spatial bag-of-words with feature and event specific tiling (Viitaniemil & Laaksonen, 2009) and Gaussian Mixture Model Super Vector (Campbell & Sturim, 2006). Since the K-means based spatial bag-of-words model with standard tiling and Gaussian Mixture Model Super Vector are standard technology, we will focus on the K-means based spatial bag-of-words model with feature and event specific tiling. For simplicity, we will refer to it as tiling. Spatial bag-of-words model is a widely used representation of the low-level image/video features. The central idea of the spatial bag-of-words model is to divide the image into some small tiles and compute bag-of-words for each tile. Figure 2 shows a couple of tiling examples. Figure 2: Examples of tiling In general, the standard spatial bag-of-words tiling uses the 1x1, 2x2 and 4x4 tiling. However the use of those tilings is ad-hoc and some preliminary works have shown that other tilings might produce better performance (Viitaniemil & Laaksonen, 2009). In our system, we systematically tested 80 different tilings to select the best one for each feature and each event. Table 2 shows the performance of feature specific tiling v.s. the standard tiling. The scores are computed from our internal experiments and are the average over 20 MED12 pre-specified events. The PMiss @ TER=12.5 metric is an official evaluation metric specified in the MED 2012 Evaluation Plan. A smaller PMiss score signifies better performance. From the table, we can see clearly that for all of the five features, the feature specific tiling performs consistently at least 1% better than the standard tiling.

Figure 3: The comparison of event specific tiling and standard tiling on Event 25 1.3 Training and Fusion We used the standard MED’12 training dataset for our internal evaluation and the training of the models for our submission. For our internal evaluation, the MED’12 training dataset was further divided into the training set and testing set by randomly selecting half of the positive examples into the training set and the other half into the testing set. The negative examples consisted of only NULL videos which do not have label information. The two classifiers used in the system were kernel SVM and kernelized rigid regression. For simplicity, we will refer to it as kernel regression. For the K-means based feature representations, we used the Chi-squared kernel. For the GMM based representation RBF kernel was used. The parameters of the model were tuned by 5-fold cross validation and the PMiss @ TER = 12.5 metric was used as the evaluation metric. For combining features from multiple modalities and the outputs of different classifiers, we used fusion and ensemble methods. More specifically, for the same classifier, we used three fusion methods to fuse different features. The fusion methods were early fusion, late fusion and double fusion (Lan, Bao, Yu, Liu, & Hauptmann, 2012). In early fusion, the kernel matrices from different features were normalized first and then combined together. In late fusion, the prediction scores from the models trained using different features were combined. In our system, we also used a fusion method called double fusion, which combines early fusion and late fusion together. Finally, the results from different classifiers were ensembled together.

O-004 Utilization of CT perfusion based patient selection for mechanical thrombectomy beyond the 7-hour window: a comparison of functional outcomes and complications. Abstract: Background Since the advent of intra-arterial (IA) therapy for acute ischemic stroke, patient selection has been largely driven by time based criteria, significantly limiting the number of patients deemed eligible for IA therapy. However emerging data suggests that image based criteria may be useful for selecting patients for IA interventions. The purpose of this study was to directly compare functional outcomes and hemorrhage rates of patients treated within a 7-h window with those treated beyond this benchmark when CT perfusion was used as the primary triage tool. Methods We retrospectively analyzed a prospectively collected database including all acute ischemic stroke patients who received IA therapy for acute ischemic stroke at the Medical University of South Carolina, regardless of time from symptom onset. At presentation CTP maps were qualitatively assessed for presence of penumbra and infarction. Selected patients underwent IA therapy. Functional outcome per the modified Rankin scale circa 90 days was determined in the clinic by a stroke neurologist. Patients unable to return to clinic were interviewed by phone. Patients were subdivided into groups before and after 7 h as it is within the suggested conventional 6–8 h time based treatment window and was the median time for our population. Results 140 patients were included in the study, however 11 of these were lost to follow-up by 90 days. The median time from symptom onset to groin access in all patients was 7.0 h. Overall, 28 patients (20%) had bleeding complications, however only 10 (7.1%) were symptomatic. The average NIHSS for patients treated within 7 h was 17.3 and 30.2% had a good outcome at 90 days (mRS 0–2). Patients treated beyond 7 h had an average NIHSS of 15.1 in and mRS 0–2 in 45.5% of those treated beyond 7 h (p=0.XXX). An additional 17.5% and 12.1%, respectively, were functionally independent with minimal disability (mRS=3) at 90 days. There was a substantial difference in hemorrhage rate with 26.1% of patients demonstrating hemorrhage on post op CT in patients treated within 7 h, compared with only 14.1% of those treated beyond 6 h (p=0.YYY). Conclusion Patients treated beyond 7 h had improved rates of good functional outcomes, return to independent living, symptomatic ICH and mortality to those treated within a 7-h time window, suggesting CTP allows safe selection of patients, especially those outside of conventional time parameters. Our findings suggest that endovascular reperfusion in acute ischemic stroke may be performed safely and effectively beyond a 7-h time window. This implies potential eligibility of patients for IA intervention who would otherwise be denied this potentially highly beneficial therapy based on time criteria.

Abstract: Introduction Flow diversion is a treatment option for large and giant anterior circulation aneurysms, however tortuosity can preclude the ability to use this therapy. Case presentation A 59-year-old female presents with cavernous sinus syndrome of the right eye and a large cavernous carotid aneurysm. Just distal to the aneurysm were two 180° turns in the carotid artery. Attempts to navigate distal to the aneurysm with traditional 0.014′ microwires resulted in herniation of the microcatheters and wires into the aneurysm. Multiple attempts using various microwires, including a “buddy-wire” system failed to navigate and deliver the microcatheter to the carotid terminus. An 0.010′ microwire was navigated to the carotid terminus however did not offer enough support to navigate a microcatheter. A microvascular snare was navigated up the contralateral carotid and across the anterior communicating artery to the ipsilateral carotid artery. The microwire was ensnared at the carotid terminus, creating a rigid and supportive monorail (Abstract P-0016 figure 1). Over this system, a 0.026” microcatheter was navigated into position and two Pipeline devices were deployed across the neck of the aneurysm, successfully embolizing the aneurysm (Abstract P-0016 figure 2).Abstract P-016 Figure 1Abstract P-016 Figure 2 Discussion Treatment of large and giant aneurysms with flow divesion can be difficult due to tortuosity and the relative stiffness of the devices. By anchoring a microwire distally, a rigid monorail system can be created to deliver the catheters into position. The snare allows for entrapping and releasing the delivery devices as needed to complete the procedure. Conclusion Challenging cases require utilization of devices that are outside normal indications, however within the capabilities of the devices. Knowledge of these technics can allow for treatment of otherwise untreatable vascular diseases. Competing interests R Turner: Microvention, Codman. ev3, Penumbra, Mindframe. A Turk: None.

Abstract: Resting-state functional MRI (rs-fMRI) is increasingly used for probing functional connectivity of the human brain. The spontaneous activity identified by rs-fMRI plays a key role in understanding the normal brain’s functional organization. It also holds valuable diagnostic and prognostic information towards various neurological or psychiatric diseases including Alzheimer’s disease, depression, schizophrenia, etc [1]. The blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) signal of fMRI detects the locations of increased neuro activity by measuring the blood oxygen levels at consecutive time points. The higher the temporal correlation between two spatially distant regions, the more likely that there is a functional connection between those regions.
- Shilpa Arora, Eric Nyberg. 2011. Assessing Benefit from Feature Feedback in Active Learning for Text Classification. Abstract: Feature feedback is an alternative to instance labeling when seeking supervision from human experts. Combination of instance and feature feedback has been shown to reduce the total annotation cost for supervised learning. However, learning problems may not benefit equally from feature feedback. It is well understood that the benefit from feature feedback reduces as the amount of training data increases. We show that other characteristics such as domain, instance granularity, feature space, instance selection strategy and proportion of relevant text, have a significant effect on benefit from feature feedback. We estimate the maximum benefit feature feedback may provide; our estimate does not depend on how the feedback is solicited and incorporated into the model. We extend the complexity measures proposed in the literature and propose some new ones to categorize learning problems, and find that they are strong indicators of the benefit from feature feedback.

Abstract: A source expansion algorithm automatically extends a given text corpus with related content from large external sources such as the Web. The expanded corpus is not intended for human consumption but can be used in question answering (QA) and other information retrieval or extraction tasks to find more relevant information and supporting evidence. We propose an algorithm that extends a corpus of seed documents with web content, using a statistical model to select text passages that are both relevant to the topics of the seeds and complement existing information.
 In an evaluation on 1,500 hand-labeled web pages, our algorithm ranked text passages by relevance with 81% MAP, compared to 43% when relying on web search engine ranks alone and 75% when using a multi-document summarization algorithm. Applied to QA, the proposed method yields consistent and significant performance gains. We evaluated the impact of source expansion on over 6,000 questions from the Jeopardy! quiz show and TREC evaluations using Watson, a state-of-the-art QA system. Accuracy increased from 66% to 71% on Jeopardy! questions and from 59% to 64% on TREC questions.

- Jeongwoo Ko, Luo Si, Eric Nyberg, T. Mitamura. 2010. Probabilistic models for answer-ranking in multilingual question-answering. Abstract: This article presents two probabilistic models for answering ranking in the multilingual question-answering (QA) task, which finds exact answers to a natural language question written in different languages. Although some probabilistic methods have been utilized in traditional monolingual answer-ranking, limited prior research has been conducted for answer-ranking in multilingual question-answering with formal methods. This article first describes a probabilistic model that predicts the probabilities of correctness for individual answers in an independent way. It then proposes a novel probabilistic method to jointly predict the correctness of answers by considering both the correctness of individual answers as well as their correlations. As far as we know, this is the first probabilistic framework that proposes to model the correctness and correlation of answer candidates in multilingual question-answering and provide a novel approach to design a flexible and extensible system architecture for answer selection in multilingual QA. An extensive set of experiments were conducted to show the effectiveness of the proposed probabilistic methods in English-to-Chinese and English-to-Japanese cross-lingual QA, as well as English, Chinese, and Japanese monolingual QA using TREC and NTCIR questions.

Building Watson: An Overview of the DeepQA Project. Abstract: IBM Research undertook a challenge to build a computer system that could compete at the human champion level in real time on the American TV Quiz show, Jeopardy! The extent of the challenge includes fielding a real-time automatic contestant on the show, not merely a laboratory exercise. The Jeopardy! Challenge helped us address requirements that led to the design of the DeepQA architecture and the implementation of Watson. After 3 years of intense research and development by a core team of about 20 researches, Watson is performing at human expert-levels in terms of precision, confidence and speed at the Jeopardy! Quiz show. Our results strongly suggest that DeepQA is an effective and extensible architecture that may be used as a foundation for combining, deploying, evaluating and advancing a wide range of algorithmic techniques to rapidly advance the field of QA.
- M. Bilotti, Jonathan L. Elsas, J. Carbonell, Eric Nyberg. 2010. Rank learning for factoid question answering with linguistic and semantic constraints. Abstract: This work presents a general rank-learning framework for passage ranking within Question Answering (QA) systems using linguistic and semantic features. The framework enables query-time checking of complex linguistic and semantic constraints over keywords. Constraints are composed of a mixture of keyword and named entity features, as well as features derived from semantic role labeling. The framework supports the checking of constraints of arbitrary length relating any number of keywords. We show that a trained ranking model using this rich feature set achieves greater than a 20% improvement in Mean Average Precision over baseline keyword retrieval models. We also show that constraints based on semantic role labeling features are particularly effective for passage retrieval; when they can be leveraged, an 40% improvement in MAP over the baseline can be realized.
- Shilpa Arora, Elijah Mayfield, C. Rosé, Eric Nyberg. 2010. Sentiment Classification using Automatically Extracted Subgraph Features. Abstract: In this work, we propose a novel representation of text based on patterns derived from linguistic annotation graphs. We use a subgraph mining algorithm to automatically derive features as frequent subgraphs from the annotation graph. This process generates a very large number of features, many of which are highly correlated. We propose a genetic programming based approach to feature construction which creates a fixed number of strong classification predictors from these subgraphs. We evaluate the benefit gained from evolved structured features, when used in addition to the bag-of-words features, for a sentiment classification task.

Abstract: We present an empirical investigation of the annotation cost estimation task for active learning in a multi-annotator environment. We present our analysis from two perspectives: selecting examples to be presented to the user for annotation; and evaluating selective sampling strategies when actual annotation cost is not available. We present our results on a movie review classification task with rationale annotations. We demonstrate that a combination of instance, annotator and annotation task characteristics are important for developing an accurate estimator, and argue that both correlation coefficient and root mean square error should be used for evaluating annotation cost estimators.
- Shilpa Arora, Eric Nyberg. 2009. Interactive Annotation Learning with Indirect Feature Voting. Abstract: We demonstrate that a supervised annotation learning approach using structured features derived from tokens and prior annotations performs better than a bag of words approach. We present a general graph representation for automatically deriving these features from labeled data. Automatic feature selection based on class association scores requires a large amount of labeled data and direct voting can be difficult and error-prone for structured features, even for language specialists. We show that highlighted rationales from the user can be used for indirect feature voting and same performance can be achieved with less labeled data. We present our results on two annotation learning tasks for opinion mining from product and movie reviews.

- Richard C. Wang, Nico Schlaefer, William W. Cohen, Eric Nyberg. 2008. Automatic Set Expansion for List Question Answering. Abstract: This paper explores the use of set expansion (SE) to improve question answering (QA) when the expected answer is a list of entities belonging to a certain class. Given a small set of seeds, SE algorithms mine textual resources to produce an extended list including additional members of the class represented by the seeds. We explore the hypothesis that a noise-resistant SE algorithm can be used to extend candidate answers produced by a QA system and generate a new list of answers that is better than the original list produced by the QA system. We further introduce a hybrid approach which combines the original answers from the QA system with the output from the SE algorithm. Experimental results for several state-of-the-art QA systems show that the hybrid system performs better than the QA systems alone when tested on list question data from past TREC evaluations.

Abstract: The thesis explores the use of a knowledge-based AI system to assist people in executing procedures and detecting events in an observed world. We extend the Scone knowledge-base system with open-ended facilities for representing time and events. Then we use this episodic knowledge representation as the foundation for our event monitoring and event detection algorithms. This approach lets us represent and reason about three fundamental aspects of the observed events: 1. their ontological character and what entities take part in these events (e.g. buying is a kind of transaction that involves an agent, a seller, money and goods) 2. how events change the world over time (e.g. after a buy event the agent has the goods rather than the money) 3. how events may be composed of other subevents (i.e. a buy event may be composed of giving money and receiving goods) We illustrate knowledge-based solutions to the event monitoring problem in the conference organization domain and to the event detection problem in the national security domain.
- M. Bilotti, Le Zhao, Jamie Callan, Eric Nyberg. 2008. Focused Retrieval over Richly-Annotated Collections. Abstract: This paper introduces a theoretical framework for focused retrieval, based on a formalism called the annotation graph. Annotation graph-based retrieval provides a rich retrieval representation that directly supports query-time constraintchecking of arbitrary relations. This representation can support focused retrieval tasks, such as Question Answering systems, which often have information needs containing constraint types that can not be queried easily under many retrieval models. The problem of annotation graph-based retrieval is mapped onto existing XML element retrieval functionality in the Indri search engine. The remainder of the paper serves to identify and discuss the issues that emerged and illustrate by example what in our opinion constitutes the upcoming research challenges facing the focused retrieval community.
- M. Bilotti, Eric Nyberg. 2008. Improving Text Retrieval Precision and Answer Accuracy in Question Answering Systems. Abstract: Question Answering (QA) systems are often built modularly, with a text retrieval component feeding forward into an answer extraction component. Conventional wisdom suggests that, the higher the quality of the retrieval results used as input to the answer extraction module, the better the extracted answers, and hence system accuracy, will be. This turns out to be a poor assumption, because text retrieval and answer extraction are tightly coupled. Improvements in retrieval quality can be lost at the answer extraction module, which can not necessarily recognize the additional answer candidates provided by improved retrieval. Going forward, to improve accuracy on the QA task, systems will need greater coordination between text retrieval and answer extraction modules.

Abstract: This paper describes the use of the Unstructured Information Management Architecture (UIMA) to integrate a set of natural language processing (NLP) tools in the RADAR system. The challenge was to define a common data model and a set of component interfaces for these tools, so that they could be integrated into a single system. The integrated system is used to pre-process each email arriving in the RADAR user’s IMAP store. We present a UIMA collection processing engine for RADAR, including a common type system for text analysis results and annotators for each of the NLP tools. The paper also includes an analysis of system performance and a discussion of the lessons learned through use the of UIMA for this integration task.

Abstract: This paper presents an overview of the IR4QA (Information Retrieval for Question Answering) Task of the NTCIR-7 ACLIA (Advanced Cross-lingual Information Access) Task Cluster. IR4QA evaluates traditional ranked retrieval of documents using wellstudied metrics such as Average Precision, but the retrieval task is embedded in the context of cross-lingual question answering. That is, document retrieval is treated as a component of the entire question answering system. This paper concentrates on how relevance assessments for the Simpified Chinese, Traditional Chinese and Japanese IR4QA test collections were obtained, and the outcome of the formal IR4QA evaluation using the three collections. For the relationship between IR4QA and the entire ACLIA task cluster, we refer the reader to the overview paper of ACLIA [17]. For details of the individual IR4QA systems, we refer the reader to the participants’ reports.

Abstract: This paper describes a probabilistic answer selection framework for question answering. In contrast with previous work using individual resources such as ontologies and the Web to validate answer candidates, our work focuses on developing a unified framework that not only uses multiple resources for validating answer candidates, but also considers evidence of similarity among answer candidates in order to boost the ranking of the correct answer. This framework has been used to select answers from candidates generated by four different answer extraction methods. An extensive set of empirical results based on TREC factoid questions demonstrates the effectiveness of the unified framework.
- Jeongwoo Ko, Eric Nyberg, Luo Si. 2007. A probabilistic graphical model for joint answer ranking in question answering. Abstract: Graphical models have been applied to various information retrieval and natural language processing tasks in the recent literature. In this paper, we apply a probabilistic graphical model for answer ranking in question answering. This model estimates the joint probability of correctness of all answer candidates, from which the probability of correctness of an individual candidate can be inferred. The joint prediction model can estimate both the correctness of individual answers as well as their correlations, which enables a list of accurate and comprehensive answers. This model was compared with a logistic regression model which directly estimates the probability of correctness of each individual answer candidate. An extensive set of empirical results based on TREC questions demonstrates the effectiveness of the joint model for answer ranking. Furthermore, we combine the joint model with the logistic regression model to improve the efficiency and accuracy of answer ranking.

Abstract: This paper presents a language-independent probabilistic answer ranking framework for question answering. The framework estimates the probability of an individual answer candidate given the degree of answer relevance and the amount of supporting evidence provided in the set of answer candidates for the question. Our approach was evaluated by comparing the candidate answer sets generated by Chinese and Japanese answer extractors with the re-ranked answer sets produced by the answer ranking framework. Empirical results from testing on NTCIR factoid questions show a 40% performance improvement in Chinese answer selection and a 45% improvement in Japanese answer selection.

Abstract: We describe recent extensions to the Ephyra question answering (QA) system and their evaluation in the TREC 2007 QA track. Existing syntactic answer extraction approaches for factoid and list questions have been complemented with a high-accuracy semantic approach that generates a semantic representation of the question and extracts answer candidates from similar semantic structures in the corpus. Candidates found by different answer extractors are combined and ranked by a statistical framework that integrates a variety of answer validation techniques and similarity measures to estimate a probability for each candidate. A novel answer type classifier combines a statistical model and hand-coded rules to predict the answer type based on syntactic and semantic features of the question. Our approach for the ‘other’ questions uses Wikipedia and Google to judge the relevance of answer candidates found in the corpora.

Abstract: I. INTRODUCTION II. MEDICAL CARE VIA THE INTERNET III. REGULATION FOR QUALITY IV. HEALTH CARE COST CONTAINMENT V. IMPORTANCE OF ON-SITE RADIOLOGY VI. OFFSHORING AND OPTIMIZATION VII. CONCLUSION I. INTRODUCTION International reading of medical imaging studies, or offshore teleradiology, has been a successful, though limited, practice benefiting patients and physicians for over a decade. Domestic and international market forces will continue to expand the demand for teleradiology as an important complement to United States based diagnostic radiology, though a full exodus of diagnostic reading to offshore sites is unlikely and inappropriate. Considerable obstacles remain to taking the teleradiology market to scale; however, barriers related to licensure, liability, quality assurance, and reimbursement will likely yield to market forces to be resolved in recognition of the significant benefits teleradiology offers to consumers and providers. II. MEDICAL CARE VIA THE INTERNET As in other aspects of the economy, the world of medicine is becoming flat as the necessity of physical proximity is becoming less essential in the doctor-patient relationship. Telemedieine, which is the use of electronic information and communication technologies to diagnose and manage medical care from a distance, is realistic, successful, and even preferred in several instances. (1) Telemedicine has existed for decades with telephone and fax, but with the Internet and the ability to view large amounts of audio and visual data at increasingly faster and cheaper rates, the practice of telemedicine is rapidly expanding. Radiology is not the only specialty affected by telemedicine and, by extension, the possibility of being offshored. Intensive care unit telemedicine is growing, and studies have shown it to achieve profoundly improved clinical and economic outcomes for both pediatric and adult populations. (2) Telepathology, which is the remote interpretation of cytological specimens, has been active for two decades and continues to grow more sophisticated as virtual laboratories are being created. (3) And tele-home care, which is the use of telemedicine in home-based settings, has shown to be successful in enabling community living older adults to maintain independence by providing monitoring of such vitals as blood sugar, blood pressure, heart rate, and mental status. (4) Even the practice of telemedicine in psychiatry has grown with one major study finding that there was no significant difference on patient satisfaction between telepsychiatric care and other specialty care via telemedicine. (5) Some patients, particularly those who were abused or suffered trauma, even show a strong preference for it. (6) Teleradiology specifically has considerable advantages for both providers and patients. One such benefit is using differences in time zones to alleviate the local burden of overnight calls and the loss of quality that comes with sleep deprivation. This service is generically known as "nighthawking" after the pioneering company NightHawk Radiology Services whose founder coined the term after nighthawk helicopter pilots on night flights in Vietnam. (7) When it is midnight on the east coast, a well-rested radiologist can be reading studies at 2 p.m. in Sydney, Australia. Teleradiology provides economic benefit to many smaller private radiology practices who would need to allocate one of their partners to staff an overnight shift which may only generate a few studies per hour while losing that staff member during the subsequent "post-call," more productive day time shift. In this case, the teleradiology service can keep its partners productive by servicing enough domestic radiology practices to keep them operating at capacity. Teleradiology also provides critical access to imaging services and timely interpretations for rural areas that cannot attract or afford on-site radiology interpretation, or alternatively in cities where the workload is too great. …

Abstract: Bag-of-words retrieval is popular among Question Answering (QA) system developers, but it does not support constraint checking and ranking on the linguistic and semantic information of interest to the QA system. We present anapproach to retrieval for QA, applying structured retrieval techniques to the types of text annotations that QA systems use. We demonstrate that the structured approach can retrieve more relevant results, more highly ranked, compared with bag-of-words, on a sentence retrieval task. We also characterize the extent to which structured retrieval effectiveness depends on the quality of the annotations.
- V. Pedro, Eric Nyberg, J. Carbonell. 2006. Federated Ontology Search. Abstract: An Ontology can be defined as a formal representation of a set of concepts within a domain and the relationships between those concepts. The development of the semantic web initiative is rapidly increasing the number of publicly available ontologies. In such a distributed environment, complex applications often need to handle multiple ontologies in order to provide adequate domain coverage. Surprisingly, there is a lack of adequate frameworks for enabling the use of multiple ontologies transparently while abstracting the particular ontological structures used by that framework. Given that any ontology represents the views of its author or authors, using multiple ontologies requires us to deal with several significant challenges, some stemming from the nature of knowledge itself, such as cases of polysemy or homography, and some stemming from the structures that we choose to represent such knowledge with. The focus of this thesis is to explore a set of techniques that will allow us to overcome some of the challenges found when using multiple ontologies, thus making progress in the creation of a functional information access platform for structured sources. In this thesis we try to address the question “How do we integrate and use information contained in a set of heterogeneous ontologies?” This question is becoming crucial as the world gets more connected. As the amount of information grows, so does the amount of resources that encode domain knowledge in different forms. At the same time, as we deal with problems that span a large number of domains, such as search, question answering and semantic analysis, the need for concurrent access to multiple ontologies becomes ever more self-evident. We model our approach on the general framework proposed in Federated Search and transpose the set of problems to the ontological domain. We start by illustrating the variety of available ontologies and focusing on automatic ontology creation. We proceed to describe the use of proactive ontology selection to guide the ontology selection process at the query level. We then propose a set of operators for ontological search centered on the user’s information needs and expand the basic operator set through composition of basic operators. We address the problem of graph merging within Ontology Search and propose a scoring metric for results that is based in the proposed operator set. Finally, we present results of using the Federated Ontology Search (FOS) engine in a set of task based evaluations. Our task set is comprised of type checking for question answering, concept coverage, concept disambiguation and content recommendation. We show that in all of the evaluated tasks, the FOS system outperforms the use of individual ontologies.

Abstract: Scenario Question Answering is a relatively new direction in Question Answering (QA) research that presents a number of challenges for evaluation. In this paper, we propose a comprehensive evaluation strategy for Scenario QA, including amethodology for building reusable test collections for Scenario QA and metrics for evaluating system performance over such test collections. Using this methodology, we have built a test collection, which we have made available for public download as a service to the research community. It is our hope that widespread availability of quality evaluation materials fuels research in new approaches to the Scenario QA task.

Abstract: This paper describes the utility of semantic resources such as the Web, WordNet and gazetteers in the answer selection process for a question-answering system. In contrast with previous work using individual semantic resources to support answer selection, our work combines multiple resources to boost the confidence scores assigned to correct answers and evaluates different combination strategies based on unweighted sums, weighted linear combinations, and logistic regression. We apply our approach to select answers from candidates produced by three different extraction techniques of varying quality, focusing on TREC questions whose answers represent locations or proper-names. Our experimental results demonstrate that the combination of semantic resources is more effective than individual resources for all three extraction techniques, improving answer selection accuracy by as much as 32.35% for location questions and 72% for proper-name questions. Of the combination strategies tested, logistic regression models produced the best results for both location and proper-name questions.

Abstract: Rapid economic and population growth in the developing world is creating wealth and increasing expectations while simultaneously straining water supply and quality. This situation will reach crisis proportions during the next several decades, and innovative water treatment technologies will be required to meet the challenge. Electrically regenerable ion exchange (LINXμ by Pionetics Corp.) is an emerging technology that is particularly well‐suited for this challenge. This article describes the LINX deionization apparatus and process, its general design considerations, and how the technology compares with conventional ion exchange, electrodialysis, and reverse osmosis (RO) deionization technologies.

Abstract: Multimodal mobile dialog systems face new challenges which do not exist in traditional spoken dialog systems. A mobile dialog system should provide robust task management during network loss, and intelligent assistance in new environments. To provide these capabilities, a system must sense changes in the user environment, and communicate them effectively to the user. In the field of human-computer interaction, such systems are referred to as context-aware systems. Two possible approaches have been explored: in one, the user requests information when needed (information pull), and in the other, the system automatically offers relevant information (information push). In this paper, we present our dialog management strategy for context-awareness using an information push model. A preliminary evaluation conducted in both labaratory and driving environments shows that context-awareness significantly improved user performance.

Abstract: This paper presents an evaluation of a spoken dialog system for automotive environments. Our overall goal was to measure the impact of user-system interaction on the user’s driving performance, and to determine whether adding context-awareness to the dialog system might reduce the degree of user distraction during driving. To address this issue, we incorporated context-awareness into a spoken dialog system, and implemented three system features using user context, network context and dialog context. A series of experiments were conducted under three different configurations: driving without a dialog system, driving while using a context-aware dialog system, and driving while using a context-unaware dialog system. We measured the differences between the three configurations by comparing the average car speed, the frequency of speed changes and the angle between the car’s direction and the centerline on the road. These results indicate that context-awareness could reduce the degree of user distraction when using a dialog system during

Abstract: Current question answering tasks handle definitional questions by seeking answers which are factual in nature. While factual answers are a very important component in defining entities, a wealth of qualitative data is often ignored. In this incipient work, we define qualitative dimensions (credibility, sentiment, contradictions etc.) for evaluating answers to definitional questions and we explore potential benefits to users. These qualitative dimensions are leveraged to uncover indirect and implicit answers and can help satisfy the user's information need.

- L. Hiyakumoto, L. Lita, Eric Nyberg. 2005. Multi-Strategy Information Extraction for Question Answering. Abstract: This paper presents a flexible approach using a utilitybased planner to choose between different extraction methods in a question-answering (QA) system, enabling multiple run-time strategies. We model the QA process as a set of probabilistic actions, and use the planner to select an action sequence maximizing the expected value of information. The planner exploits redundancy and diversity by dynamically selecting among three statistical and pattern-based answer extractor actions in an end-to-end QA system. The expected value of information produced by each extractor is modeled as a function of the current question context. Experiments demonstrate that a planningbased approach can outperform a fixed strategy using the single-best extractor.

Abstract: This paper attempts to analyze and bound the utility of various structured and unstructured resources in Question Answering, independent of a specific system or component. We quantify the degree to which gazetteers, web resources, encyclopedia, web documents and web-based query expansion can help Question Answering in general and specific question types in particular. Depending on which resources are used, the QA task may shift from complex answer-finding mechanisms to simpler data extraction methods followed by answer re-mapping in local documents.

Abstract: We describe new consumer services based on speech processing technologies to support a new digital/mobile era of ubiquitous communication. First, we propose, a compact and noise robust embedded speech recognition middleware implemented on microprocessors focused on sophisticated HMIs (human machine interfaces) for car information systems (i.e. car telematics). Second, we report on a novel and sophisticated dialog management/manager (DM) system, based on VoiceXML (voice extensible markup language), called CAMMIA (conversational agent for multimedia mobile information access). The proposed DM handles two important issues: an automatic generation scheme for lexicons and grammars, and an effective combination/merger between automatic speech recognition (ASR) and natural language processing (NLP). The new DM scheme has been evaluated for an application of the car telematics service task after integration with ASR and a VoiceXML interpreter (VXI).
- H. Sagawa, T. Mitamura, Eric Nyberg. 2004. A comparison of confirmation styles for error handling in a speech dialog system. Abstract: Speech recognition errors are inevitable in a speech dialog system. It is important to provide a dialog flow that allows the user to correct system errors and quickly return to the original dialog. This paper describes explicit, final and implicit confirmation styles that are implemented in the CAMMIA speech dialog system, and compares them from the viewpoint of usability. Our results show that a final confirmation with fewer confirmation turns is preferred by the user when there is no error in the dialog. On the other hand, an explicit confirmation is preferred when an error occurs.

This paper presents an error handling method based on correction grammars which recognize the correction utterances which follow a recognition error. Correction grammars are dynamically created from existing grammars and a set of correction templates. We also describe a prototype dialog system which incorporates this error handling method, and provide empirical evidence that this method can improve dialog success rate and reduce the number of dialog turns required for error recovery.
- V. Pedro, Jeongwoo Ko, Eric Nyberg, T. Mitamura. 2004. An Information Repository Model for Advanced Question Answering Systems. Abstract: This paper presents the design and implementation of the information repository which is the central core of the JAVELIN opendomain question answering system. JAVELIN is comprised of several modules that perform a wide variety of question answering (QA) tasks, such as question analysis, document and passage retrieval, answer candidate extraction, answer selection, answer justification, and planning. The architecture is designed to support comparative component-level evaluation, so that different strategies for each module can be integrated and tested in a straightforward way. Each time a module uses a particular piece of information to produce an output, a dependency is created. To support answer justification and introspective learning, the system can use this longterm memory to trace the origin of each answer it produces for a particular question. The JAVELIN Repository implements a complete, consistent relational model for all of the information associated with a question answering scenario.

Diagnostics were designed and implemented to address the most difficult rewrites for authors, based on an empirical analysis of log files containing over 180,000 sentences. The design and implementation of the diagnostic system are presented, along with experimental results from an empirical evaluation of the completed system. We found that the diagnostic system can correctly identify the problem in 90.2% of the cases. In addition, depending on the type of grammar problem, the diagnostic system may offer a rewritten sentence. We found that 89.4% of the rewritten sentences were correctly rewritten. The results suggest that these methods could be used as the basis for an automatic rewriting system in the future.

Abstract: The characteristics of VoiceXML make it an attractive choice for the implementation of embedded dialog systems on networked hardware. Nevertheless, VoiceXML lacks some important features found in existing proprietary approaches. It is difficult to build a complex, multi-dialog system directly in VoiceXML. This paper describes DialogXML, an extension to VoiceXML that supports a more implicitly declarative language for dialog scenarios, and ScenarioXML, a straightforward combination of DialogXML with the template-filling mechanism of Java Server Pages. The paper describes an initial prototype system, which extends the OpenVXI VoiceXML interpreter for DialogXML, implements a web server for ScenarioXML, and utilizes the KANTOO natural language analyzer for understanding user inputs.

Abstract: The use of knowledge-based machine translation with controlled technical text can produce high-quality translations. However, building and maintaining knowledge bases can require significant time and effort, since they typically involve handcoding of semantic preferences. When a system can't disambiguate based on semantic preferences, it can initiate interactive disambiguation with the author to improve the likelihood of an accurate translation, but this decreases the productivity of text authoring. In this paper, we present an experimental evaluation of automatic disambiguation strategies which could eliminate the need for interactive structural disambiguation in the KANT machine translation system.

Abstract: A method and apparatus in which a blunt interior needle is positioned within a larger external needle and a sample cavity is formed at the blunt end of the interior needle. An optical fiber extends from the sample cavity up the interior needle and to a light source and light detector. A reflective surface is placed at the end of the sample cavity reflects light back to the optical fiber. A beam splitter separates the incident and reflected light. To make an in-vivo measurement of chemical concentrations in a body, the needle is inserted into the body and fluids are aspirated into the sample cavity. Light is then transmitted to the cavity by the optical fiber and is transmitted from the cavity to a detector by the same fiber. By measuring the amount of light reflected, one can determine the amount of light absorbed in the cavity and may thus determine concentrations of selected chemicals.

Abstract: The KANT system (Knowledge-based, Accurate Natural-language Translation) is a set of software tools for automatic and interactive analysis of source text and generation of target text ( Mi amura, et al., 1991). It has been primarily targeted towards the translation of technical text in controlled subdomains (Mitamura and Nyberg, 1995). Initially an outgrowth of research ideas following the completion of the KBMT-89 system at CMU ( Goodman and Nirenburg, 1990), KANT has been scaled up for multilingual document production in an industrial setting. In this paper, we discuss the facets of KANT which are of potential interest to the LISA audience: its technical foundation, its intended domain(s) of application, its current performance, and our future plans regarding its application and commercialization.

Characterization of Ligand Binding of a Soluble Human Insulin-like Growth Factor I Receptor Variant Suggests a Ligand-induced Conformational Change*. Abstract: Details of the signal transduction mechanisms of the tyrosine kinase family of growth factor receptors remain elusive. In this work, we describe an extensive study of kinetic and thermodynamic aspects of growth factor binding to a soluble extracellular human insulin-like growth factor-I receptor (sIGF-IR) variant. The extracellular receptor domains were produced fused to an IgG-binding protein domain (Z) in transfected human 293 cells as a correctly processed secreted α-β′-Z dimer. The receptor was purified using IgG affinity chromatography, rendering a pure and homogenous protein in yields from 1 to 5 mg/liter of conditioned cell media. Biosensor technology (BIAcore) was applied to measure the insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I), des(1-3)IGF-I, insulin-like growth factor-II, and insulin ligand binding rate constants to the immobilized IGF-IR-Z. The association equilibrium constant, Ka, for the IGF-I interaction is determined to 2.8 × 108 M−1 (25 °C). Microcalorimetric titrations on IGF-I/IGF-IR-Z were performed at three different temperatures (15, 25, and 37 °C) and in two different buffer systems at 25 °C. From these measurements, equilibrium constants for the 1:1 (IGF-I:(α-β′-Z)2) receptor complex in solution are deduced to 0.96 × 108 M−1 (25 °C). The determined heat capacity change for the process is large and negative, −(1)0.51 kcal (K mol)−1. Further, the entropy change (ΔS) at 25 °C is large and negative. Far- and near-UV circular dichroism measurements display significant changes over the entire wavelength range upon binding of IGF-I to IGF-IR-Z. These data are all consistent with a significant change in structure of the system upon IGF-I binding.

In the continuing development of the KANT system (Mitamura, et al., 1991; Mitamura and Nyberg, 1995), we have explored different sublanguage techniques which limit the complexity of natural language analysis, thus increasing the likelihood of an accurate translation. In this presentation, we will describe some of the general techniques that have been developed for sublanguage use within the KANT system.
- Tangqiu Li, Eric Nyberg, J. Carbonell. 1996. Chinese Sentence Generation in a Knowledge-Based Machine Translation System. Abstract: This paper presents a technique for generating Chinese sentences from the Interlingua expressions used in the KANT knowledge-based machine translation system. Chinese sentences are generated directly from the semantic representation using a unificationbased generation formalization which takes advantage of certain linguistic features of Chinese. Direct generation from the semantic form eliminates the need for an intermediate syntactic structure, thus simplifying the generation procedure. The generation algorithm is top-down, data-driven and recursive. The descriptive nature of the pseudo-unification grammar formalism used in KANT allows the grammar developer to write very straightforward semantic grammar rules. We also discuss some of the crucial problems in Chinese language generation, and describe how they can be dealt with in our framework. This technique has been implemented in a prototype Chinese sentence generation system for KANT. Some implementation details and experimental results concerning the prototype are presented at the end of this paper.

Abstract: In this paper, we describe the design and deployment of KANT Controlled English (KCE) for knowledge-based machine translation in the KANT system. KCE combines three kinds of constraints: constraints on the lexicon; constraints on the complexity of sentences; and the use of generalized markup language. We describe how each of these types of language control are utilized in the implementation of a typical KANT application. The principles described are not specific to knowledge-based MT, and can be applied in the design of controlled languages for any kind of MT application.

Abstract: A methodology is presented for component-based machine translation (MT) evaluation through causal error analysis to complement existing global evaluation methods. This methodology is particularly appropriate for knowledge-based machine translation (KBMT) systems. After a discussion of MT evaluation criteria and the particular evaluation metrics proposed for KBMT, we apply this methodology to a large-scale application of the KANT machine translation system, and present some sample results.

Abstract: In an interlingual knowledge-based machine translation system, ambignuity arises when the source language analyzer produces more than one interlingua expression for a source sentence. This can have a negative impact on translation quality, since a target sentence may be produced from an unintended meaning. In this paper we describe the methods used in the KANT machine translation system to reduce or eliminate ambiguity in a large-scale application domain. We also test these methods on a large corpus of test sentences, in order to illustrate how the different disambiguation methods reduce the average number of parses per sentence.

Abstract: Large-scale lexical knowledge acquisition is one of the most time critical steps in developing a knowledge-based machine translation system. In particular, developing the syntactic lexicon for the target language can be an unwieldy task, as on-line knowledge assets are likely to be more scarce than for the source language. This paper addresses this problem within the KANT machine translation system and describes how we structure the KA process to address this problem. This was done by first determining the nature of the desired process and then developing tools to implement that process. The tools themselves and the ways in which the helped us to realize our design goals are described. We conclude that, while the problem of lexical acquisition can be formidable, it can be overcome with proper foresight and tool design.<<ETX>>
- T. Mitamura, Eric Nyberg, J. Carbonell. 1993. Automated Corpus Analysis and the Acquisition of Large, Multi-Lingual Knowledge Bases for MT. Abstract: Although knowledge-based MT systems have the potential to achieve high translation accuracy, each successful application system requires a large amount of hand-coded knowledge (lexicons, grammars, mapping rules, etc.). Systems like KBMT-89 and its descendants have demonstrated how knowledge-based translation can produce good results in technical domains with tractable domain semantics. Nevertheless, the cost of developing large-scale applications with tens of thousands of domain concepts precludes a purely hand-crafted approach. The current challenge for the "next generation" of knowledge-based MT systems is to utilize on-line textual resources and corpus analysis software in order to automate the most laborious aspects of the knowledge acquisition process. This partial automation can in turn maximize the productivity of human knowledge engineers and help to make large-scale applications of knowledge-based MT an economic reality. In this paper we discuss the corpus-based knowledge acquisition methodology used in KANT, a knowledge-based translation system for multi-lingual document production. This methodology can be generalized beyond the KANT interlingua approach for use with any system that requires similar kinds of knowledge.

- T. Mitamura, Eric Nyberg. 1992. Hierarchical Lexical Structure and Interpretive Mapping in Machine Translation. Abstract: Large-scale knowledge-based machine translation requires significant amounts of lexical knowledge in order to map syntactic structures to conceptual structures. This paper presents a framework in which lexical knowledge is separated into different levels of representation, which are arranged in a hierarchical model based on principles of knowledge representation and lexical semantics. The proposed methodology is language-independent, and has been used to organize lexical knowledge for both English and Japanese.
- J. Carbonell, T. Mitamura, Eric Nyberg. 1992. The KANT perspective: a critique of pure transfer (and pure interlingua, pure statistics, .. ). Abstract: There is a strong tendency among MT researchers to emphasize paradigmatic differences in MT approaches. This often leads to energetic criticism of competing systems, but obscures the fact that many techniques developed within a particular paradigm can improve the quality of MT systems in general. In this paper we show how practical MT development must move beyond dogmatic dismissal of differing approaches to an integrated, rational approach to MT which combines the best that each paradigm has to offer. We then discuss KANT, a practical MT system which makes use of techniques from the interlingua, statistical, and transfer-based MT paradigms to produce accurate, high-quality translation.
- Eric Nyberg, T. Mitamura. 1992. The KANT System: Fast, Accurate, High-Quality Translation in Practical Domains. Abstract: Knowledge-based interlingual machine translation systems produce semantically accurate translations, but typically require massive knowledge acquisition. Ongoing research and development at the Center for Machine Translation has focussed on reducing this requirement to produce large-scale practical applications of knowledge-based MT. This paper describes KANT, the first system to combine principled source language design, semi-automated knowledge acquisition, and knowledge compilation techniques to produce fast, high-quality translation to multiple languages.

Abstract: Knowledge-based interlingual machine translation systems produce semantically accurate translations, but typically require massive knowledge acquisition. This paper describes KANT, a system that reduces this requirement to produce practical, scalable, and accurate KBMT applications. First, the set of requirements is discussed, then the full KANT architecture is illustrated, and finally results from a fully implemented prototype are presented.
- John R. R. Leavitt, Eric Nyberg. 1990. The DIBBS blackboard control architecture and its application to distributed natural language processing. Abstract: The authors present DIBBS, a domain-independent blackboard system that has been used for applications in distributed natural language processing (NLP). It is shown how the explicit representation of control knowledge as units on the DIBBS control blackboard allows an application to implement dynamic control strategies and reason about its own problem-solving performance. The DIBBS truth maintenance dependency network allows robust treatment of control issues in conflict resolution. All of these properties makes DIBBS especially appropriate for applications in distributed NLP, such as the DIOGENES and DIANA systems.<<ETX>>
- S. Nirenburg, V. Lesser, Eric Nyberg. 1989. Controlling a Language Generation Planner. Abstract: The set of partially interdependent lexical and syntactic decisions that have to be made in the process of natural language generation are best seen as a complex planning and search problem. This paper discusses the phenomena involved in natural language generation planning and argues that a blackboard-type architecture with agenda-style control is more appropriate for this task than a sequential control architecture with backtracking. The blackboard architecture we describe is implemented in the language generator DIOGENES.
- S. Nirenburg, R. Mccardell, Eric Nyberg, S. Huffman, Edward Kenschaft, Irene B. Nirenburg. 1988. Lexical realization in natural language generation. Abstract: This paper describes a procedure for lexical selection of open-class lexical items in a natural language generation system. An optimum lexical selection module must be able to make realization decisions under varying contextual circumstances. First, it must be able to operate without the influence of context, based on meaning correspondences between elements of conceptual input and the lexical inventory of the target language. Second, it must be able to use contextual constraints, as supported by collocational information in the generation lexicon. Third, there must be an option of realizing input representations pronominally or through definite descriptions. Finally, there must also be an option of using elliptical constructions. The nature of background knowledge and the algorithm we suggest for this task are described. The lexical selection procedure is a part of a comprehensive generation system, DIOGENES. 1 Our place on the generation research map. Natural language generation is traditionally divided into two stages: the utterance planning ('what to say') stage and the lexical and syntactic realization ('how to say it') stage. The latter stage consists, essentially, of a large set of realization choices for the various meanings of the input, using the morphological, syntactic and lexical means of expression in the target language (TL). Research reported here deals with the process of lexical selection during this second stage of generation. Many of the existing generation systems have been conceived as components of natural language interfaces to database systems. In such generators the lexical inventory can be strongly constrained without jeopardizing the quality of the interaction (cf, e.g., McKeown, 1985). Such systems necessarily concentrate on choosing appropriate TL syntax indeed, generators are expected to produce adequate syntactic structures. Lexical selection becomes more important when it is difficult to constrain the types of output in generation, and, consequently, when the lexicon becomes large. Machine translation and automatic text summarization are among applications that by nature require a wide range of outputs and have to use a sizable lexicon. Note that of these two, the former does not involve utterance planning and concentrates on lexical and syntactic realization. In the natural language generation community, attention to the task of lexical selection attention has recently grown. Of course, it has always been recognized as an important problem (cf. Danlos, 1984; Jacobs, 1985; Bienkowski, 1986; and the survey Cumming, 1986) and was addressed in a well-known early generation project (Goldman, 1975). However, most major NLG efforts of the early 1980s (e.g., Mann and Matthiessen, 1985; McDonald, 1983; McKeown, 1985, Appelt, 1985) concentrated more on syntactic and stylistic realization as well as to text planning than to lexical selection. Among those who dealt with lexical selection was the SEMSYN project (Rösner, 1986). Currently, work on lexical selection is going on at the University of Pennsylvania (e.g., Marcus, 1987) and at University of California at Berkeley (Ward, 1988). Still, the set of problems facing this field is significant. One motivation for our research was that we agree with Marcus (1987, p. 211) that at present 'most generation systems don't use words at all,' and we believe that the quality of generation output will improve significantly once an adequate lexical selection component becomes a standard part of a NLG system.
