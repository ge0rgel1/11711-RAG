Abstract: Across a variety of ranking tasks, researchers use reciprocal rank to measure the effectiveness for users interested in exactly one relevant item. Despite its widespread use, evidence suggests that reciprocal rank is brittle when discriminating between systems. This brittleness, in turn, is compounded in modern evaluation settings where current, high-precision systems may be difficult to distinguish. We address the lack of sensitivity of reciprocal rank by introducing and connecting it to the concept of best-case retrieval, an evaluation method focusing on assessing the quality of a ranking for the most satisfied possible user across possible recall requirements. This perspective allows us to generalize reciprocal rank and define a new preference-based evaluation we call lexicographic precision or lexiprecision. By mathematical construction, we ensure that lexiprecision preserves differences detected by reciprocal rank, while empirically improving sensitivity and robustness across a broad set of retrieval and recommendation tasks.

Abstract: As online music platforms grow, music recommender systems play a vital role in helping users navigate and discover content within their vast musical databases. At odds with this larger goal, is the presence of popularity bias, which causes algorithmic systems to favor mainstream content over, potentially more relevant, but niche items. In this work we explore the intrinsic relationship between music discovery and popularity bias. To mitigate this issue we propose a domain-aware, individual fairness-based approach which addresses popularity bias in graph neural network (GNNs) based recommender systems. Our approach uses individual fairness to reflect a ground truth listening experience, i.e., if two songs sound similar, this similarity should be reflected in their representations. In doing so, we facilitate meaningful music discovery that is robust to popularity bias and grounded in the music domain. We apply our BOOST methodology to two discovery based tasks, performing recommendations at both the playlist level and user level. Then, we ground our evaluation in the cold start setting, showing that our approach outperforms existing fairness benchmarks in both performance and recommendation of lesser-known content. Finally, our analysis explains why our proposed methodology is a novel and promising approach to mitigating popularity bias and improving the discovery of new and niche content in music recommender systems.

Abstract: The TREC Fair Ranking Track aims to provide a platform for participants to develop and evaluate novel retrieval algorithms that can provide a fair exposure to a mixture of demographics or attributes, such as ethnicity, that are represented by relevant documents in response to a search query. For example, particular demographics or attributes can be represented by the documents' topical content or authors. The 2021 Fair Ranking Track adopted a resource allocation task. The task focused on supporting Wikipedia editors who are looking to improve the encyclopedia's coverage of topics under the purview of a WikiProject. WikiProject coordinators and/or Wikipedia editors search for Wikipedia documents that are in need of editing to improve the quality of the article. The 2021 Fair Ranking track aimed to ensure that documents that are about, or somehow represent, certain protected characteristics receive a fair exposure to the Wikipedia editors, so that the documents have an fair opportunity of being improved and, therefore, be well-represented in Wikipedia. The under-representation of particular protected characteristics in Wikipedia can result in systematic biases that can have a negative human, social, and economic impact, particularly for disadvantaged or protected societal groups.
- Fernando Diaz, Bhaskar Mitra. 2023. Recall, Robustness, and Lexicographic Evaluation. Abstract: Researchers use recall to evaluate rankings across a variety of retrieval, recommendation, and machine learning tasks. While there is a colloquial interpretation of recall in set-based evaluation, the research community is far from a principled understanding of recall metrics for rankings. The lack of principled understanding of or motivation for recall has resulted in criticism amongst the retrieval community that recall is useful as a measure at all. In this light, we reflect on the measurement of recall in rankings from a formal perspective. Our analysis is composed of three tenets: recall, robustness, and lexicographic evaluation. First, we formally define `recall-orientation' as sensitivity to movement of the bottom-ranked relevant item. Second, we analyze our concept of recall orientation from the perspective of robustness with respect to possible searchers and content providers. Finally, we extend this conceptual and theoretical treatment of recall by developing a practical preference-based evaluation method based on lexicographic comparison. Through extensive empirical analysis across 17 TREC tracks, we establish that our new evaluation method, lexirecall, is correlated with existing recall metrics and exhibits substantially higher discriminative power and stability in the presence of missing labels. Our conceptual, theoretical, and empirical analysis substantially deepens our understanding of recall and motivates its adoption through connections to robustness and fairness.

Abstract: Retrieval augmentation has shown promising improvements in different tasks. However, whether such augmentation can assist a large language model based re-ranker remains unclear. We investigate how to augment T5-based re-rankers using high-quality information retrieved from two external corpora -- a commercial web search engine and Wikipedia. We empirically demonstrate how retrieval augmentation can substantially improve the effectiveness of T5-based re-rankers for both in-domain and zero-shot out-of-domain re-ranking tasks.

Redefining Relationships in Music. Abstract: AI tools increasingly shape how we discover, make and experience music. While these tools can have the potential to empower creativity, they may fundamentally redefine relationships between stakeholders, to the benefit of some and the detriment of others. In this position paper, we argue that these tools will fundamentally reshape our music culture, with profound effects (for better and for worse) on creators, consumers and the commercial enterprises that often connect them. By paying careful attention to emerging Music AI technologies and developments in other creative domains and understanding the implications, people working in this space could decrease the possible negative impacts on the practice, consumption and meaning of music. Given that many of these technologies are already available, there is some urgency in conducting analyses of these technologies now. It is important that people developing and working with these tools address these issues now to help guide their evolution to be equitable and empower creativity. We identify some potential risks and opportunities associated with existing and forthcoming AI tools for music, though more work is needed to identify concrete actions which leverage the opportunities while mitigating risks.
- Fernando Diaz, Andr√©s Ferraro. 2022. Offline Retrieval Evaluation Without Evaluation Metrics. Abstract: Offline evaluation of information retrieval and recommendation has traditionally focused on distilling the quality of a ranking into a scalar metric such as average precision or normalized discounted cumulative gain. We can use this metric to compare the performance of multiple systems for the same request. Although evaluation metrics provide a convenient summary of system performance, they also collapse subtle differences across users into a single number and can carry assumptions about user behavior and utility not supported across retrieval scenarios. We propose recall-paired preference (RPP), a metric-free evaluation method based on directly computing a preference between ranked lists. RPP simulates multiple user subpopulations per query and compares systems across these pseudo-populations. Our results across multiple search and recommendation tasks demonstrate that RPP substantially improves discriminative power while correlating well with existing metrics and being equally robust to incomplete data.

Abstract: Although information access systems have long supportedpeople in accomplishing a wide range of tasks, we propose broadening the scope of users of information access systems to include task-driven machines, such as machine learning models. In this way, the core principles of indexing, representation, retrieval, and ranking can be applied and extended to substantially improve model generalization, scalability, robustness, and interpretability. We describe a generic retrieval-enhanced machine learning (REML) framework, which includes a number of existing models as special cases. REML challenges information retrieval conventions, presenting opportunities for novel advances in core areas, including optimization. The REML research agenda lays a foundation for a new style of information access research and paves a path towards advancing machine learning and artificial intelligence.

Abstract: There is increasing attention to evaluating the fairness of search system ranking decisions. These metrics often consider the membership of items to particular groups, often identified using protected attributes such as gender or ethnicity. To date, these metrics typically assume the availability and completeness of protected attribute labels of items. However, the protected attributes of individuals are rarely present, limiting the application of fair ranking metrics in large scale systems. In order to address this problem, we propose a sampling strategy and estimation technique for four fair ranking metrics. We formulate a robust and unbiased estimator which can operate even with very limited number of labeled items. We evaluate our approach using both simulated and real world data. Our experimental results demonstrate that our method can estimate this family of fair ranking metrics and provides a robust, reliable alternative to exhaustive or random data annotation.
- Brian St. Thomas, Praveen Chandar, Christine Hosey, Fernando Diaz. 2021. Mixed Method Development of Evaluation Metrics. Abstract: Designers of online search and recommendation services often need to develop metrics to assess system performance. This tutorial focuses on mixed methods approaches to developing user-focused evaluation metrics. This starts with choosing how data is logged or how to interpret current logged data, with a discussion of how qualitative insights and design decisions can restrict or enable certain types of logging. When we create a metric from that logged data, there are underlying assumptions about how users interact with the system and evaluate those interactions. We will cover what these assumptions look like for some traditional system evaluation metrics and highlight quantitative and qualitative methods that investigate and adapt these assumptions to be more explicit and expressive of genuine user behavior. We discuss the role that mixed methods teams can play at each stage of metric development, starting with data collection, designing both online and offline metrics, and supervising metric selection for decision making. We describe case studies and examples of these methods applied in the context of evaluating personalized search and recommendation systems. Finally, we close with practical advice for applied quantitative researchers who may be in the early stages of planning collaborations with qualitative researchers for mixed methods metrics development.

Abstract: This article considers how media workers and organizations make use of the abundance of metrics available in the contemporary online environment. The expansion of audience measurement on digital music platforms, dashboard analytics, and third-party providers raises broad societal concerns about the quantification of culture; however, less attention has been paid to how professionals in the music industries approach, understand, and deploy these metrics in their work. Drawing on survey and interview data, we found that music workers do not take metrics on faith or reject them out of hand; rather, they make sense of them, deploy them strategically, and narrate their meanings to give themselves rationales to make investments and predictions and to persuade others to do so.
- Fernando Diaz. 2021. On Evaluating Session-Based Recommendation with Implicit Feedback. Abstract: Session-based recommendation systems are used in environments where system recommendation actions are interleaved with user choice reactions. Domains include radio-style song recommendation, session-aware related-items in a shopping context, and next video recommendation. In many situations, interactions logged from a production policy can be used to train and evaluate such session-based recommendation systems. This paper presents several concerns with interpreting logged interactions as reflecting user preferences and provides possible mitigation to those concerns.
- Ruohan Li, Jianxiang Li, Bhaskar Mitra, Fernando Diaz, Asia J. Biega. 2021. Exposing Query Identification for Search Transparency. Abstract: Search systems control the exposure of ranked content to searchers. In many cases, creators value not only the exposure of their content but, moreover, an understanding of the specific searches where the content is surfaced. The problem of identifying which queries expose a given piece of content in the ranked results is an important and relatively underexplored search transparency challenge. Exposing queries are useful for quantifying various issues of search bias, privacy, data protection, security, and search engine optimization. Exact identification of exposing queries in a given system is computationally expensive, especially in dynamic contexts such as web search. We explore the feasibility of approximate exposing query identification (EQI) as a retrieval task by reversing the role of queries and documents in two classes of search systems: dense dual-encoder models and traditional BM25. We then improve upon this approach through metric learning over the retrieval embedding space. We further derive an evaluation metric to measure the quality of a ranking of exposing queries, as well as conducting an empirical analysis of various practical aspects of approximate EQI. Overall, our work contributes a novel conception of transparency in search systems and computational means of achieving it.
- Michael D. Ekstrand, Anubrata Das, R. Burke, Fernando Diaz. 2021. Fairness in Information Access Systems. Abstract: Recommendation, information retrieval, and other information access systems pose unique challenges for investigating and applying the fairness and non-discrimination concepts that have been developed for studying other machine learning systems. While fair information access shares many commonalities with fair classification, the multistakeholder nature of information access applications, the rank-based problem setting, the centrality of personalization in many cases, and the role of user response complicate the problem of identifying precisely what types and operationalizations of fairness may be relevant, let alone measuring or promoting them. In this monograph, we present a taxonomy of the various dimensions of fair information access and survey the literature to date on this new and rapidly-growing topic. We preface this with brief introductions to information access and algorithmic fairness, to facilitate use of this work by scholars with experience in one (or neither) of these fields who wish to learn about their intersection. We conclude with several open problems in fair information access, along with some suggestions for how to approach research in this space.

Abstract: While current information retrieval systems are effective for known-item retrieval where the searcher provides a precise name or identifier for the item being sought, systems tend to be much less effective for cases where the searcher is unable to express a precise name or identifier. We refer to this as tip of the tongue (TOT) known-item retrieval, named after the cognitive state of not being able to retrieve an item from memory. Using movie search as a case study, we explore the characteristics of questions posed by searchers in TOT states in a community question answering website. We analyze how searchers express their information needs during TOT states in the movie domain. Specifically, what information do searchers remember about the item being sought and how do they convey this information? Our results suggest that searchers use a combination of information about: (1) the content of the item sought, (2) the context in which they previously engaged with the item, and (3) previous attempts to find the item using other resources (e.g., search engines). Additionally, searchers convey information by sometimes expressing uncertainty (i.e., hedging), opinions, emotions, and by performing relative (vs. absolute) comparisons with attributes of the item. As a result of our analysis, we believe that searchers in TOT states may require specialized query understanding methods or document representations. Finally, our preliminary retrieval experiments show the impact of each information type presented in information requests on retrieval performance.

Abstract: Two-sided marketplaces are an important component of many existing Internet services like Airbnb and Amazon, which have both consumers (e.g. users) and producers (e.g. retailers). Traditionally, the recommendation system in these platforms mainly focuses on maximizing customer satisfaction by recommending the most relevant items based on the learned user preference. However, it has been shown in previous works that solely optimizing the satisfaction of customers may lead to unfair exposure of items, which jeopardizes the benefits of producers. To tackle this problem, we propose a fairness-aware recommendation framework by using multi-objective optimization, Multi-FR , to adaptively balance the objectives between consumers and producers. In particular, Multi-FR adopts the multi-gradient descent to generate a Pareto set of solutions, where the most appropriate one is selected from the Pareto set. In addition, four fairness metrics/constraints are applied to make the recommendation results on both the consumer and producer side fair. We extensively evaluate our model on three real-world datasets, comparing with grid-search methods and using a variety of performance metrics. The experimental results demonstrate that Multi-FR can improve the recommendation fairness on both the consumer and producer side with little drop in recommendation quality, also outperforming several state-of-the-art fair ranking approaches.

Abstract: The world of empirical machine learning (ML) strongly relies on benchmarks in order to determine the relative effectiveness of different algorithms and methods. This paper proposes the notion of"a benchmark lottery"that describes the overall fragility of the ML benchmarking process. The benchmark lottery postulates that many factors, other than fundamental algorithmic superiority, may lead to a method being perceived as superior. On multiple benchmark setups that are prevalent in the ML community, we show that the relative performance of algorithms may be altered significantly simply by choosing different benchmark tasks, highlighting the fragility of the current paradigms and potential fallacious interpretation derived from benchmarking ML methods. Given that every benchmark makes a statement about what it perceives to be important, we argue that this might lead to biased progress in the community. We discuss the implications of the observed phenomena and provide recommendations on mitigating them using multiple machine learning domains and communities as use cases, including natural language processing, computer vision, information retrieval, recommender systems, and reinforcement learning.

Abstract: This paper provides an overview of the NIST TREC 2020 Fair Ranking track. For 2020, we again adopted an academic search task, where we have a corpus of academic article abstracts and queries submitted to a production academic search engine. The central goal of the Fair Ranking track is to provide fair exposure to different groups of authors (a group fairness framing). We recognize that there may be multiple group definitions (e.g. based on demographics, stature, topic) and hoped for the systems to be robust to these. We expected participants to develop systems that optimize for fairness and relevance for arbitrary group definitions, and did not reveal the exact group definitions until after the evaluation runs were submitted.The track contains two tasks,reranking and retrieval, with a shared evaluation.

Abstract: In email interfaces, providing users with reply suggestions may simplify or accelerate correspondence. While the ‚Äúsuccess‚Äù of such systems is typically quantified using the number of suggestions selected by users, this ignores the impact of social context, which can change how suggestions are perceived. To address this, we developed a mixed-methods framework involving qualitative interviews and crowdsourced experiments to characterize problematic email reply suggestions. Our interviews revealed issues with over-positive, dissonant, cultural, and gender-assuming replies, as well as contextual politeness. In our experiments, crowdworkers assessed email scenarios that we generated and systematically controlled, showing that contextual factors like social ties and the presence of salutations impacts users‚Äô perceptions of email correspondence. These assessments created a novel dataset of human-authored corrections for problematic email replies. Our study highlights the social complexity of providing suggestions for email correspondence, raising issues that may apply to all social messaging systems.

Abstract: Asking clarifying questions in response to search queries has been recognized as a useful technique for revealing the underlying intent of the query. Clarification has applications in retrieval systems with different interfaces, from the traditional web search interfaces to the limited bandwidth interfaces as in speech-only and small screen devices. Generation and evaluation of clarifying questions have been recently studied in the literature. However, user interaction with clarifying questions is relatively unexplored. In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive study by analyzing large-scale user interactions with clarifying questions in a major web search engine. In more detail, we analyze the user engagements received by clarifying questions based on different properties of search queries, clarifying questions, and their candidate answers. We further study click bias in the data, and show that even though reading clarifying questions and candidate answers does not take significant efforts, there still exist some position and presentation biases in the data. We also propose a model for learning representation for clarifying questions based on the user interaction data as implicit feedback. The model is used for re-ranking a number of automatically generated clarifying questions for a given query. Evaluation on both click data and human labeled data demonstrates the high quality of the proposed method.

Abstract: Article 5(1)(c) of the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) requires that "personal data shall be [...] adequate, relevant, and limited to what is necessary in relation to the purposes for which they are processed (`data minimisation')". To date, the legal and computational definitions of 'purpose limitation' and 'data minimization' remain largely unclear. In particular, the interpretation of these principles is an open issue for information access systems that optimize for user experience through personalization and do not strictly require personal data collection for the delivery of basic service. In this paper, we identify a lack of a homogeneous interpretation of the data minimization principle and explore two operational definitions applicable in the context of personalization. The focus of our empirical study in the domain of recommender systems is on providing foundational insights about the (i) feasibility of different data minimization definitions, (ii) robustness of different recommendation algorithms to minimization, and (iii) performance of different minimization strategies.We find that the performance decrease incurred by data minimization might not be substantial, but that it might disparately impact different users---a finding which has implications for the viability of different formal minimization definitions. Overall, our analysis uncovers the complexities of the data minimization problem in the context of personalization and maps the remaining computational and regulatory challenges.

Abstract: We introduce the concept of expected exposure as the average attention ranked items receive from users over repeated samples of the same query. Furthermore, we advocate for the adoption of the principle of equal expected exposure: given a fixed information need, no item should receive more or less expected exposure than any other item of the same relevance grade. We argue that this principle is desirable for many retrieval objectives and scenarios, including topical diversity and fair ranking. %Leveraging user models from existing retrieval metrics, we propose a general evaluation methodology based on expected exposure and draw connections to related metrics in information retrieval evaluation. Importantly, this methodology relaxes classic information retrieval assumptions, allowing a system, in response to a query, to produce a distribution over rankings instead of a single fixed ranking. We study the behavior of the expected exposure metric and stochastic rankers across a variety of information access conditions, including ad hoc retrieval and recommendation. %We believe that measuring and optimizing expected exposure metrics using randomization opens a new area for retrieval algorithm development and progress.

Abstract: Past research shows that users benefit from systems that support them in their writing and exploration tasks. The autosuggestion feature of Web search engines is an example of such a system: It helps users formulate their queries by offering a list of suggestions as they type. Such autosuggestions are typically generated by machine learning (ML) systems trained on a corpus of search logs and document representations. These automated methods can however become prone to issues that might result in the system making problematic suggestions that are biased, racist, sexist or in other ways inappropriate. While current search engines have become increasingly proficient at suppressing many types of problematic suggestions, there are still persistent issues that remain. In this paper, we reflect on past efforts and on why certain issues still linger by covering explored solutions along a prototypical pipeline for identifying, detecting, and mitigating problematic autosuggestions. To showcase their complexity, we discuss several dimensions of problematic suggestions, difficult issues along the pipeline, and why our discussion applies to an increasing number of applications (beyond Web search) that implement similar textual suggestion features. By outlining several persistent social and technical challenges in moderating Web search suggestions, we hope to provide a renewed call for action.
- Alexandra Olteanu, Fernando Diaz, G. Kazai. 2020. When Are Search Completion Suggestions Problematic?. Abstract: Problematic web search query completion suggestions-perceived as biased, offensive, or in some other way harmful-can reinforce existing stereotypes and misbeliefs, and even nudge users towards undesirable patterns of behavior. Locating such suggestions is difficult, not only due to the long-tailed nature of web search, but also due to differences in how people assess potential harms. Grounding our study in web search query logs, we explore when system-provided suggestions might be perceived as problematic through a series of crowd-experiments where we systematically manipulate: the search query fragments provided by users, possible user search intents, and the list of query completion suggestions. To examine why query suggestions might be perceived as problematic, we contrast them to an inventory of known types of problematic suggestions. We report our observations around differences in the prevalence of a) suggestions that are problematic on their own versus b) suggestions that are problematic for the query fragment provided by a user, for both common informational needs and in the presence of web search voids-topics searched by few to no users. Our experiments surface a rich array of scenarios where suggestions are considered problematic, including due to the context in which they were surfaced. Compounded by the elusive nature of many such scenarios, the prevalence of suggestions perceived as problematic only for certain user inputs, raises concerns about blind spots due to data annotation practices that may lead to some types of problematic suggestions being overlooked.
- Michael D. Ekstrand, R. Burke, Fernando Diaz. 2019. Fairness and Discrimination in Retrieval and Recommendation. Abstract: Fairness and related concerns have become of increasing importance in a variety of AI and machine learning contexts. They are also highly relevant to information retrieval and related problems such as recommendation, as evidenced by the growing literature in SIGIR, FAT*, RecSys, and special sessions such as the FATREC workshop and the Fairness track at TREC 2019; however, translating algorithmic fairness constructs from classification, scoring, and even many ranking settings into information retrieval and recommendation scenarios is not a straightforward task. This tutorial will help to orient IR researchers to algorithmic fairness, understand how concepts do and do not translate from other settings, and provide an introduction to the growing literature on this topic.

Abstract: Social data in digital form‚Äîincluding user-generated content, expressed or implicit relations between people, and behavioral traces‚Äîare at the core of popular applications and platforms, driving the research agenda of many researchers. The promises of social data are many, including understanding ‚Äúwhat the world thinks‚Äù about a social issue, brand, celebrity, or other entity, as well as enabling better decision-making in a variety of fields including public policy, healthcare, and economics. Many academics and practitioners have warned against the na√Øve usage of social data. There are biases and inaccuracies occurring at the source of the data, but also introduced during processing. There are methodological limitations and pitfalls, as well as ethical boundaries and unexpected consequences that are often overlooked. This paper recognizes the rigor with which these issues are addressed by different researchers varies across a wide range. We identify a variety of menaces in the practices around social data use, and organize them in a framework that helps to identify them. ‚ÄúFor your own sanity, you have to remember that not all problems can be solved. Not all problems can be solved, but all problems can be illuminated.‚Äù ‚ÄìUrsula Franklin1

Incorporating Query Term Independence Assumption for Efficient Retrieval and Ranking using Deep Neural Networks. Abstract: Classical information retrieval (IR) methods, such as query likelihood and BM25, score documents independently w.r.t. each query term, and then accumulate the scores. Assuming query term independence allows precomputing term-document scores using these models---which can be combined with specialized data structures, such as inverted index, for efficient retrieval. Deep neural IR models, in contrast, compare the whole query to the document and are, therefore, typically employed only for late stage re-ranking. We incorporate query term independence assumption into three state-of-the-art neural IR models: BERT, Duet, and CKNRM---and evaluate their performance on a passage ranking task. Surprisingly, we observe no significant loss in result quality for Duet and CKNRM---and a small degradation in the case of BERT. However, by operating on each query term independently, these otherwise computationally intensive models become amenable to offline precomputation---dramatically reducing the cost of query evaluations employing state-of-the-art neural ranking models. This strategy makes it practical to use deep models for retrieval from large collections---and not restrict their usage to late stage re-ranking.
- Muhammad Imran, Carlos Castillo, Fernando Diaz, Sarah Vieweg. 2018. Processing Social Media Messages in Mass Emergency: Survey Summary. Abstract: Millions of people use social media to share information during disasters and mass emergencies. Information available on social media, particularly in the early hours of an event when few other sources are available, can be extremely valuable for emergency responders and decision makers, helping them gain situational awareness and plan relief efforts. Processing social media content to obtain such information involves solving multiple challenges, including parsing brief and informal messages, handling information overload, and prioritizing different types of information. These challenges can be mapped to information processing operations such as filtering, classifying, ranking, aggregating, extracting, and summarizing. This work highlights these challenges and presents state of the art computational techniques to deal with social media messages, focusing on their application to crisis scenarios.

Abstract: The NLP and ML communities have long been interested in developing models capable of common-sense reasoning, and recent works have significantly improved the state of the art on benchmarks like the Winograd Schema Challenge (WSC). Despite these advances, the complexity of tasks designed to test common-sense reasoning remains under-analyzed. In this paper, we make a case study of the Winograd Schema Challenge and, based on two new measures of instance-level complexity, design a protocol that both clarifies and qualifies the results of previous work. Our protocol accounts for the WSC's limited size and variable instance difficulty, properties common to other common-sense benchmarks. Accounting for these properties when assessing model results may prevent unjustified conclusions.

Evaluation typically takes one of three forms: (1) smaller lab studies with real users; (2) batch tests with offline collections, judgements, and measures; (3) large-scale controlled experiments (e.g. A/B tests) looking at implicit feedback. But it is rare for the first to inform and influence the latter two; in particular, implicit feedback metrics often have to be continuously revised and updated as assumptions are found to be poorly supported. Mixed methods research enables practitioners to develop robust evaluation metrics by combining strengths of both qualitative and quantitative approaches. In this tutorial, we will show how qualitative research on user behavior provides insight on the relationship between implicit signals and satisfaction. These insights can inform and augment quantitative modeling and analysis for online and offline metrics and evaluation.

Abstract: We study the use and evaluation of a system for supporting music discovery, the experience of finding and listening to content previously unknown to the user. We adopt a mixed methods approach, including interviews, unsupervised learning, survey research, and statistical modeling, to understand and evaluate user satisfaction in the context of discovery. User interviews and survey data show that users' behaviors change according to their goals, such as listening to recommended tracks in the moment, or using recommendations as a starting point for exploration. We use these findings to develop a statistical model of user satisfaction at scale from interactions with a music streaming platform. We show that capturing users' goals, their deviations from their usual behavior, and their peak interactions on individual tracks are informative for estimating user satisfaction. Finally, we present and validate heuristic metrics that are grounded in user experience for online evaluation of recommendation performance. Our findings, supported with evidence from both qualitative and quantitative studies, reveal new insights about user expectations with discovery and their behavioral responses to satisfying and dissatisfying systems.

Towards a Fair Marketplace: Counterfactual Evaluation of the trade-off between Relevance, Fairness & Satisfaction in Recommendation Systems. Abstract: Two-sided marketplaces are platforms that have customers not only on the demand side (e.g. users), but also on the supply side (e.g. retailer, artists). While traditional recommender systems focused specifically towards increasing consumer satisfaction by providing relevant content to consumers, two-sided marketplaces face the problem of additionally optimizing for supplier preferences, and visibility. Indeed, the suppliers would want afair opportunity to be presented to users. Blindly optimizing for consumer relevance may have a detrimental impact on supplier fairness. Motivated by this problem, we focus on the trade-off between objectives of consumers and suppliers in the case of music streaming services, and consider the trade-off betweenrelevance of recommendations to the consumer (i.e. user) andfairness of representation of suppliers (i.e. artists) and measure their impact on consumersatisfaction. We propose a conceptual and computational framework using counterfactual estimation techniques to understand, and evaluate different recommendation policies, specifically around the trade-off between relevance and fairness, without the need for running many costly A/B tests. We propose a number of recommendation policies which jointly optimize relevance and fairness, thereby achieving substantial improvement in supplier fairness without noticeable decline in user satisfaction. Additionally, we consider user disposition towards fair content, and propose a personalized recommendation policy which takes into account consumer's tolerance towards fair content. Our findings could guide the design of algorithms powering two-sided marketplaces, as well as guide future research on sophisticated algorithms for joint optimization of user relevance, satisfaction and fairness.
- Hamed Zamani, Mostafa Dehghani, Fernando Diaz, Hang Li, Nick Craswell. 2018. SIGIR 2018 Workshop on Learning from Limited or Noisy Data for Information Retrieval. Abstract: In recent years, machine learning approaches, and in particular deep neural networks, have yielded significant improvements on several natural language processing and computer vision tasks; however, such breakthroughs have not yet been observed in the area of information retrieval. Besides the complexity of IR tasks, such as understanding the user's information needs, a main reason is the lack of high-quality and/or large-scale training data for many IR tasks. This necessitates studying how to design and train machine learning algorithms where there is no large-scale or high-quality data in hand. Therefore, considering the quick progress in development of machine learning models, this is an ideal time for a workshop that especially focuses on learning in such an important and challenging setting for IR tasks. The goal of this workshop is to bring together researchers from industry---where data is plentiful but noisy---with researchers from academia---where data is sparse but clean to discuss solutions to these related problems.
- Bhaskar Mitra, Fernando Diaz, Nick Craswell. 2017. Luandri: A Clean Lua Interface to the Indri Search Engine. Abstract: In recent years, the information retrieval (IR) community has witnessed the first successful applications of deep neural network models to short-text matching and ad-hoc retrieval tasks. However, the two communities - focused on deep neural networks and on IR - have less in common when it comes to the choice of programming languages. Indri, an indexing framework popularly used by the IR community, is written in C++, while Torch, a popular machine learning library for deep learning, is written in the light-weight scripting language Lua. To bridge this gap, we introduce Luandri (pronounced "laundry"), a simple interface for exposing the search capabilities of Indri to Torch models implemented in Lua.
- Fernando Diaz. 2017. Spotify: Music Access At Scale. Abstract: Spotify provides users with access to a massive repository of streaming music. While some aspects of music access are familiar to the information retrieval community (e.g. semistructured data, item recommendation), nuances of the music domain require the development of new models of user understanding, intent modeling, relevance, and content understanding. These models can be studied using the large amount of content and usage data at Spotify, allowing us to extend previous results in the music information retrieval community. In this presentation, we will highlight the research involved in developing Spotify and outline a research program for large scale music access.
- Omar Alonso, S. Tremblay, Fernando Diaz. 2017. Automatic Generation of Event Timelines from Social Data. Abstract: Over the past few years, social media has seen phenomenal growth and has become a very important source for getting real time updates from different parts of the world. While the notion of a trend usually reflects current events, the amount of information accumulated over a period of time can be used to provide another perspective for such events in the form of a timeline. In this paper, we present a technique that uses social information as relevance surrogates to generate an informative timeline. A core component is a variation of pseudo relevance feedback that is automatically generated using social data without external evidence. Finally, we describe the implementation of such technique and present evaluation results using a real-world data set.

Abstract: Many online services, such as search engines, social media platforms, and digital marketplaces, are advertised as being available to any user, regardless of their age, gender, or other demographic factors. However, there are growing concerns that these services may systematically underserve some groups of users. In this paper, we present a framework for internally auditing such services for differences in user satisfaction across demographic groups, using search engines as a case study. We first explain the pitfalls of naively comparing the behavioral metrics that are commonly used to evaluate search engines. We then propose three methods for measuring latent differences in user satisfaction from observed differences in evaluation metrics. To develop these methods, we drew on ideas from the causal inference literature and the multilevel modeling literature. Our framework is broadly applicable to other online services, and provides general insight into interpreting their evaluation metrics.
- Ryen W. White, Fernando Diaz, Qi Guo. 2017. Search Result Prefetching on Desktop and Mobile. Abstract: Search result examination is an important part of searching. High page load latency for landing pages (clicked search results) can reduce the efficiency of the search process. Proactively prefetching landing pages in advance of clickthrough can save searchers valuable time. However, prefetching consumes resources (primarily bandwidth and battery) that are wasted unless the prefetched results are requested by searchers. Balancing the costs in prefetching particular results against the benefits in reduced latency to searchers represents the search result prefetching challenge. In this article, we introduce this challenge and present methods to address it in both desktop and mobile settings. Our methods leverage searchers‚Äô cursor movements (on desktop) and viewport-based viewing behavior (on mobile) on search engine result pages (SERPs) in real time to dynamically estimate the result that searchers will request next. We demonstrate through large-scale log analysis that our approach significantly outperforms three strong baselines that prefetch results based on (i) the search engine result ranking (prefetch top-ranked results), (ii) past SERP clicks from all searchers for the query (prefetch popular results), or (iii) past SERP clicks from the current searcher for the query (prefetch results that the searcher prefers). Our promising findings have implications for the design of search support in desktop and mobile settings that makes the search process more efficient.

Summarization Approach From Microblog During Disaster Events. Abstract: During bulk convergence events such as natural disasters, microblogging platforms like Twitter are broadly used by affected people to post situational awareness messages. As soon as natural disaster events happen, users are willing to know more about them. Twitter is a great source that can be exploited for obtaining such fine-grained arranged information for fresh natural disaster events. These crisis-related messages disperse among multiple categories like infrastructure damage, information about bomb blast, missing, injured, and dead people etc. The challenge here is to create summary from disaster related tweets and filter the short spam url containing tweets.
- Carlos Castillo, Fernando Diaz, Y. Lin, Jie Yin. 2016. The Fourth International Workshop on Social Web for Disaster Management (SWDM 2016). Abstract: The proliferation of social media platforms together with the wide adoption of smartphone devices has transformed how we communicate and share news. During large-scale emergencies, such as natural disasters or armed attacks, victims, responders, and volunteers increasingly use social media to post situation updates and to request and offer help. The use of social media for emergency and disaster response has been a prominent application of information and knowledge management techniques in recent years. There are a number of challenges associated with near real-time processing of vast volumes of information in a way that makes sense for people directly affected, for volunteer organizations, and for official emergency response agencies. As massive amount of messages posted by users are transformed into semi-structured records via information extraction and natural language processing techniques, there is a growing need for developing advanced techniques to aggregate this large-scale data to gain an understanding of the ``big picture'' of an emergency, and to detect and predict how a disaster could develop. This workshop seeks to provide a platform for the exchange of ideas, identification of important problems, and discovery of possible synergies. It will enable interesting discussions and encouraged collaboration between various disciplines, and information and knowledge management approaches is the core of this workshop.

Abstract: High-dimensional observations and complex real-world dynamics present major challenges in reinforcement learning for both function approximation and exploration. We address both of these challenges with two complementary techniques: First, we develop a gradient-boosting style, non-parametric function approximator for learning on $Q$-function residuals. And second, we propose an exploration strategy inspired by the principles of state abstraction and information acquisition under uncertainty. We demonstrate the empirical effectiveness of these techniques, first, as a preliminary check, on two standard tasks (Blackjack and $n$-Chain), and then on two much larger and more realistic tasks with high-dimensional observation spaces. Specifically, we introduce two benchmarks built within the game Minecraft where the observations are pixel arrays of the agent's visual field. A combination of our two algorithmic techniques performs competitively on the standard reinforcement-learning tasks while consistently and substantially outperforming baselines on the two tasks with high-dimensional observation spaces. The new function approximator, exploration strategy, and evaluation benchmarks are each of independent interest in the pursuit of reinforcement-learning methods that scale to real-world domains.

In this presentation, I will concentrate on open problems in production systems that academia is better suited for addressing than industry.
- Fernando Diaz, Solon Barocas. 2016. WSDM 2016 Workshop on the Ethics of Online Experimentation. Abstract: Online experimentation is now a core and near-constant part of the operation of a production online service, such as a web search engine or social media service. These are large-scale experiments that involve research subjects often numbering in the hundreds of thousands and wide-ranging, computer-automated variations in experimental treatment. In some cases, the results of online experiments may be of use internally to optimize system performance (for example, a test may be conducted to help make web page layout decisions). In other cases, the results may be of academic interest (for example, an experiment may be conducted to test a hypothesis about human behavior). Because of their rapid deployment and broad impact, online experimentation systems provide an extremely valuable tool for scientists and engineers. Despite this statistical power, in some situations, an online experiment can raise difficult ethical questions. One only needs to revisit the conversations resulting from the Facebook emotional contagion experiment to understand that some experiments may, at the very least, warrant careful review before being conducted. Since this episode, scholarship published mainly in the qualitative research and information law communities indicates that this may not be an isolated incident. Ethical and legal problems probably arise in other online experiments, published or not. As experimentation platforms and users become easily accessible, scientists and practitioners may increasingly put the well-being and trust of end users at risk. In light of these concerns, organizations often review online experiments before they are actually conducted. In production settings, the review process might vary with respect to formality or standards across companies and even groups within companies. When intended or used for academic publication, experiments or data may have undergone inconsistent review processes, some implementing academic-style institutional review boards and others none at all. Although there is a suggestion that service providers are concerned about the wellbeing of end users, the community does not

Abstract: Classic learning to rank algorithms are trained using a set of labeled documents, pairs of documents, or rankings of documents. Unfortunately, in many situations, gathering such labels requires significant overhead in terms of time and money. We present an algorithm for training a learning to rank model using a set of labeled features elicited from system designers or domain experts. Labeled features incorporate a system designer's belief about the correlation between certain features and relative relevance. We demonstrate the efficacy of our model on a public learning to rank dataset. Our results show that we outperform our baselines even when using as little as a single feature label.

- Fernando Diaz. 2016. Lecture 10 : Advanced Evaluation. Abstract: Web searchers often exhibit directed search behaviors such as navigating to a particular Website. However, in many circumstances they exhibit different behaviors that involve issuing many queries and visiting many results. In such cases, it is not clear whether the user‚Äôs rationale is to intentionally explore the results or whether they are struggling to find the information they seek. Being able to disambiguate between these types of long search sessions is important for search engines both in performing retrospective analysis to understand search success, and in developing real-time support to assist searchers. The difficulty of this challenge is amplified since many of the characteristics of exploration (e.g., multiple queries, long duration) are also observed in sessions where people are struggling. In this paper, we analyze struggling and exploring behavior in Web search using log data from a commercial search engine. We first compare and contrast search behaviors along a number dimensions, including query dynamics during the session. We then build classifiers that can accurately distinguish between exploring and struggling sessions using behavioral and topical features. Finally, we show that by considering the struggling/exploring prediction we can more accurately predict search satisfaction.

Abstract: Continuous space word embeddings have received a great deal of attention in the natural language processing and machine learning communities for their ability to model term similarity and other relationships. We study the use of term relatedness in the context of query expansion for ad hoc information retrieval. We demonstrate that word embeddings such as word2vec and GloVe, when trained globally, underperform corpus and query specific embeddings for retrieval tasks. These results suggest that other tasks benefiting from global embeddings may also benefit from local embeddings.

Abstract: There is a large body of research on utilizing online activity as a survey of political opinion to predict real world election outcomes. There is considerably less work, however, on using this data to understand topic-specific interest and opinion amongst the general population and specific demographic subgroups, as currently measured by relatively expensive surveys. Here we investigate this possibility by studying a full census of all Twitter activity during the 2012 election cycle along with the comprehensive search history of a large panel of Internet users during the same period, highlighting the challenges in interpreting online and social media activity as the results of a survey. As noted in existing work, the online population is a non-representative sample of the offline world (e.g., the U.S. voting population). We extend this work to show how demographic skew and user participation is non-stationary and difficult to predict over time. In addition, the nature of user contributions varies substantially around important events. Furthermore, we note subtle problems in mapping what people are sharing or consuming online to specific sentiment or opinion measures around a particular topic. We provide a framework, built around considering this data as an imperfect continuous panel survey, for addressing these issues so that meaningful insight about public interest and opinion can be reliably extracted from online and social media data.

Abstract: Unexpected news events, such as natural disasters or other human tragedies, create a large volume of dynamic text data from official news media as well as less formal social media. Automatic real-time text summarization has become an important tool for quickly transforming this overabundance of text into clear, useful information for end-users including affected individuals, crisis responders, and interested third parties. Despite the importance of real-time summarization systems, their evaluation is not well understood as classic methods for text summarization are inappropriate for real-time and streaming conditions. The TREC 2013-2015 Temporal Summarization (TREC-TS) track was one of the first evaluation campaigns to tackle the challenges of real-time summarization evaluation, introducing new metrics, ground-truth generation methodology and dataset. In this paper, we present a study of TREC-TS track evaluation methodology, with the aim of documenting its design, analyzing its effectiveness, as well as identifying improvements and best practices for the evaluation of temporal summarization systems.

Abstract: We present a system based on sequential decision making for the online summarization of massive document streams, such as those found on the web. Given an event of interest (e.g. "Boston marathon bombing"), our system is able to filter the stream for relevance and produce a series of short text updates describing the event as it unfolds over time. Unlike previous work, our approach is able to jointly model the relevance, comprehensiveness, novelty, and timeliness required by time-sensitive queries. We demonstrate a 28.3% improvement in summary F1 and a 43.8% improvement in time-sensitive F1 metrics.

Abstract: In the field of computer science, large-scale experimentation on users is not new. However, driven by advances in artificial intelligence, novel autonomous systems for experimentation are emerging that raise complex, unanswered questions for the field. Some of these questions are computational, while others relate to the social and ethical implications of these systems. We see these normative questions as urgent because they pertain to critical infrastructure upon which large populations depend, such as transportation and healthcare. Although experimentation on widely used online platforms like Facebook has stoked controversy in recent years, the unique risks posed by autonomous experimentation have not received sufficient attention, even though such techniques are being trialled on a massive scale. In this paper, we identify several questions about the social and ethical implications of autonomous experimentation systems. These questions concern the design of such systems, their effects on users, and their resistance to some common mitigations.

- Bhaskar Mitra, Fernando Diaz, Nick Craswell. 2016. Learning to Match using Local and Distributed Representations of Text for Web Search. Abstract: Models such as latent semantic analysis and those based on neural embeddings learn distributed representations of text, and match the query against the document in the latent semantic space. In traditional information retrieval models, on the other hand, terms have discrete or local representations, and the relevance of a document is determined by the exact matches of query terms in the body text. We hypothesize that matching with distributed representations complements matching with traditional local representations, and that a combination of the two is favourable. We propose a novel document ranking model composed of two separate deep neural networks, one that matches the query and the document using a local representation, and another that matches the query and the document using learned distributed representations. The two networks are jointly trained as part of a single neural network. We show that this combination or 'duet' performs significantly better than either neural network individually on a Web page ranking task, and significantly outperforms traditional baselines and other recently proposed models based on neural networks.

Abstract: The SIGIR 2015 Workshop on Reproducibility, Inexplicability, and Generalizability of Results (RIGOR) took place on Thursday, August 13, 2015 in Santiago, Chile. The goal of the workshop was two fold. The first to provide a venue for the publication and presentation of negative results. The second was to provide a venue through which the authors of open source search engines could compare performance of indexing and searching on the same collections and on the same machines - encouraging the sharing of ideas and discoveries in a like-to-like environment. In total three papers were presented and seven systems participated.
- Jaime Arguello, Fernando Diaz, Jimmy J. Lin, A. Trotman. 2015. SIGIR 2015 Workshop on Reproducibility, Inexplicability, and Generalizability of Results (RIGOR). Abstract: Many, if not most, published research papers in Information Retrieval (IR) describe the following process: the authors identify an opportunity to improve on a particular IR task, implement an experimental system, and compare its performance against one or more baselines (or a control condition, in the case of a user study). The quality of the research is judged based on the magnitude of the improvement and whether the methodological choices suggest external validity and generalizability, for example, whether the experimental setup is ‚Äúrealistic‚Äù or whether the baseline methods reflect the state of the art. Unfortunately, research demonstrating the failure to reproduce or generalize previous results does not have a similar publication venue. This sort of result‚Äîoften referred to as a ‚Äònegative result‚Äô‚Äîserves to control the quality of published research in a scientific discipline and to better understand the limits of previously published methods. Publication venues for such research exist in fields such as ecology, biomedicine, pharmacy,, and social science. The SIGIR 2015 Workshop on Reproducibility, Inexplicability, and Generalizability of Results (RIGOR) aims to provide a venue for publication and discussion of IR research that fails to reproduce a previously published result under the same or similar experimental conditions (e.g., same test collection and system configuration) and research that demonstrates the failure to generalize an existing approach to a new domain. To this end, we have developed a set of categories covering different ways in which a result may

We received 14 workshop proposals, each of which was peer-reviewed by three members of the Workshops PC. After discussion of all submissions in the Workshops PC, as well as with the PC Chairs of the technical program, 7 workshops were accepted (50% acceptance rate). We sought to include topics that covered the breadth of expertise in the SIGIR community, would appeal to a diverse range of SIGIR attendees, and would push the state-of-the-art in IR research. We greatly appreciate all authors who submitted a proposal for consideration and all reviewers for their help in selecting which proposals to include in the program. Finally, we are grateful to Microsoft Research for providing workshop fee waivers for thirty-five students. This year's workshops include new explorations of established topics such as temporal information retrieval, personalization, and question answering. The Workshop on Temporal, Social and Spatially-aware Information Access (#TAIA2015), now in its fourth year at SIGIR, explores the relationship between temporal information access and other data sources. Similarly, the Workshop on Social Personalization & Search (SPS2015) studies the opportunities for improved personalization provided by social data. The Web Question Answering Workshop studies next generation QA systems that go beyond simple factoid questions. In addition to these familiar topics, you will find workshops investigating entirely new subareas of information retrieval. The Workshop on Reproducibility, Inexplicability, and Generalizability of Results (RIGOR) focuses on testing the robustness of existing results in information retrieval. The Workshop on Privacy-Preserving Information Retrieval, which is in its second year, draws together researchers from the privacy and retrieval communities to improve the sensitivity of information retrieval research to user privacy concerns. The Graph Search Workshop studies information retrieval in highly structured information spaces, bringing some of the research topics from industry into a public academic venue. Last but not least, the Workshop on Neuro- Physiological Methods in Information Retrieval Research covers topics on the novel use of physiological data for information retrieval. We believe this year's workshop program reflects the diversity of information retrieval research and are excited for the new directions it will enable and inspire. We hope you find this program interesting and thought-provoking.
- Chris Kedzie, K. McKeown, Fernando Diaz. 2015. Predicting Salient Updates for Disaster Summarization. Abstract: During crises such as natural disasters or other human tragedies, information needs of both civilians and responders often require urgent, specialized treatment. Monitoring and summarizing a text stream during such an event remains a difficult problem. We present a system for update summarization which predicts the salience of sentences with respect to an event and then uses these predictions to directly bias a clustering algorithm for sentence selection, increasing the quality of the updates. We use novel, disaster-specific features for salience prediction, including geo-locations and language models representing the language of disaster. Our evaluation on a standard set of retrospective events using ROUGE shows that salience prediction provides a significant improvement over other approaches.
- J. Aslam, Matthew Ekstrand-Abueg, Virgil Pavlu, Fernando Diaz, R. McCreadie, T. Sakai. 2015. TREC 2015 Temporal Summarization Track Overview. Abstract: There are many summarization scenarios that require updates to be issued to users over time. For example, during unexpected news events such as natural disasters or mass protests new information rapidly emerges. The TREC Temporal Summarization track aims to investigate how to e‚Üµectively summarize these types of event in real-time. In particular, the goal is to develop systems which can detect useful, new, and timely sentence-length updates about a developing event to return to the user. In contrast to classical summarization challenges (such as DUC or TAC), the summaries produced by the participant systems are evaluated against a ground truth list of information nuggets representing the space of information that a user might want to know about each event. An optimal summary will cover all of the information nuggets in the minimum number of sentences. Also in contrast to classic summarization and newer timeline generation tasks, the Temporal Summarization track focuses on performing this analysis online as documents are indexed. For the third 2015 edition of the Temporal Summarization track, we had four main aims. First, to better address the issues with run incompleteness by producing larger run pools and by using pool expansion based on sentence similarity. Second, to lower the barrier to entry for new groups by providing multiple sub-tasks using corpora of varying sizes, allowing groups to pick the task(s) that their infrastructure can cope with. Third, to refine the metrics to better incorporate latency by considering timeliness against the corpus as well as against updates to the Wikipedia page. Finally, to continue to increase the number of events covered by the evaluation. This is the final year of the Temporal Summarization track. For 2016, the track will merge with the Microblog track to become the new Real-Time Summarization (RTS) Track. This new RTS track will still tackle the same challenges as the Temporal Summarization track, but will incorporate microblog streams and will include a new Living-Lab style evaluation in addition to the classical

Abstract: This paper describes an overview of the NTCIR-11[1] Cooking Recipe Search pilot task (the first RecipeSearch task). In this pilot task, we explore the information access tasks associated with cooking recipes. Our subtasks include ad hoc recipe search and recipe pairing. We summarize the English/Japanese test collections and our task design to develop the collections, and then report official results of the evaluation experiments. In this task, a corpus of approximately 100,000 English recipes have been used for the English search. For the Japanese search, a corpus of approximately 440,000 Japanese recipes has been used. In the ad hoc and recipe pairing subtasks, 500 and 100 queries have been developed, in English and Japanese, respectively. In the task, four research groups participated, and 31 search runs in total have been submitted.

Abstract: Document-level relevance judgments are a major component in the calculation of effectiveness metrics. Collecting high-quality judgments is therefore a critical step in information retrieval evaluation. However, the nature of and the assumptions underlying relevance judgment collection have not received much attention. In particular, relevance judgments are typically collected for each document in isolation, although users read each document in the context of other documents. In this work, we aim to investigate the nature of relevance judgment collection. We collect relevance labels in both isolated and conditional setting, and ask for judgments in various dimensions of relevance as well as overall relevance. Then we compare the relevance metrics based on various types of judgments with other metrics of quality such as user preference. Our analyses illuminate how these settings for judgment collection affect the quality and the characteristics of the judgments. We also find that the metrics based on conditional judgments show higher correlation with user preference than isolated judgments.

Abstract: Spatial and temporal context are increasingly important as users rely more on mobile devices to access information on the Web. Although information access applications are becoming more context-savvy, users‚Äô expectations are far ahead of current capabilities. For example, users expect a given application to understand the nature of their current immediate surroundings, while many systems have trouble drawing an accurate map of a city, or assigning a geographic and temporal scope to a web document. Successfully incorporating spatial and temporal context into the retrieval and user models opens up a universe of hyperlocal scenarios. Users provide an unprecedented volume of detailed, and continuously updated information about where they are, what they are doing, who they are with, and what they are thinking and feeling about their current activities. The provision of this stream creates an informal contract between the user and the information access application that the user will provide the information, but the application must provide results that are contextually relevant. Many of the research questions about how to understand and employ user context have yet to be answered. We bring together practitioners and researchers, in a program centered around short papers, keynote speakers, and discussion of recent breakthroughs and challenges in spatial and temporal information access, from algorithmic and architectural perspectives.
- Fernando Diaz. 2014. Experimentation Standards for Crisis Informatics. Abstract: Easy access to online media has led to an escalation of researchers and companies developing information analysis systems for use in crisis response. These systems use state of the art text mining algorithms to extract information from online media to support crisis responders and other users. Published research in this area has primarily focused on systems leveraging public social media feeds such as Twitter. These results often are supported by samples of social media manually analyzed using a combination of hired assessors and data mining algorithms. Unfortunately, despite leveraging open data like Twitter, the current experimental environment for crisis informatics does not rely on open test collections or evaluation methodologies. Social media samples are often collected by individual research sites and not shared. Assessment is often conducted by crowd-workers or in-house editors, at times with little attention paid to inter-site consistency or to real use cases. Consequently, crisis informatics results are difficult to compare across research publications and to apply to real situations. This article makes the argument that information access algorithms that support crisis response require standard evaluation metrics and experimental corpora. There are two objectives for such a initiative: (a) encourage open and reproducible experimentation on crisis informatics, and (b) develop standard evaluation metrics for use by decision-makers. Information retrieval researchers are in a unique position to assist in the development of algorithms, methodology, and working systems for use in crisis response.
- Fernando Diaz, Michael Gamon, J. Hofman, Emre Kƒ±cƒ±man, David M. Rothschild. 2014. Online And Social Media Data As A Flawed Continuous Panel Survey. Abstract: There is a large body of research on utilizing online activity to predict various real world outcomes, ranging from outbreaks of influenza to outcomes of elections. There is considerably less work, however, on using this data to understand topic-specific interest and opinion amongst the general population and specific demographic subgroups, as currently measured by relatively expensive surveys. Here we investigate this possibility by studying a full census of all Twitter activity during the 2012 election cycle along with comprehensive search history of a large panel of internet users during the same period, highlighting the challenges in interpreting online and social media activity as the results of a survey. As noted in existing work, the online population is a non-representative sample of the offline world (e.g., the U.S. voting population). We extend this work to show how demographic skew and user participation is non-stationary and unpredictable over time. In addition, the nature of user contributions varies wildly around important events. Finally, we note subtle problems in mapping what people are sharing or consuming online to specific sentiment or opinion measures around a particular topic. These issues must be addressed before meaningful insight about public interest and opinion can be reliably extracted from online and social media data.

- Pavel Metrikov, Fernando Diaz, S√©bastien Lahaie, Justin M. Rao. 2014. Whole page optimization: how page elements interact with the position auction. Abstract: We study the trade-off between layout elements of the search results page and revenue in the real-time sponsored search auction. Using data from a randomized experiment on a major search engine, we find that having images present among the search results tends to simultaneously raise the ad click-through rate and flatten the ad click curve, reducing the premium for occupying the top slot and thus impacting bidding incentives. Theoretical analysis shows that this type of change creates an ambiguous impact on revenue in equilibrium: a steeper curve with lower total click-through rate is preferable only if the expected revenue distribution is skewed enough towards the top bidder. Empirically, we show that this is a relatively rare phenomenon, and we also find that whole page satisfaction causally raises the click-through rate of the ad block. This means search engines have a short-run incentive to boost search result quality, not just a long-run incentive based on competition between providers.
- Milad Shokouhi, R. Jones, Umut Ozertem, Karthik Raghunathan, Fernando Diaz. 2014. Mobile query reformulations. Abstract: Users frequently interact with web search systems on their mobile devices via multiple modalities, including touch and speech. These interaction modes are substantially different from the user experience on desktop search. As a result, system designers have new challenges and questions around understanding the intent on these platforms. In this paper, we study the query reformulation patterns in mobile logs. We group query reformulations based on their input method into four categories; text-text, text-voice, voice-text and voice-voice. We discuss the unique characteristics of each of these groups by comparing them against each other and desktop logs. We also compare the distribution of reformulation types (e.g. adding/dropping words) against desktop logs and show that there are new classes of reformulations that are caused by errors in speech recognition. Our results suggest that users do not tend to switch between different input types (e.g. voice and text). Voice to text switches are largely caused by speech recognition errors, and text to voice switches are unlikely to be about the same intent.
- Alexandra Olteanu, Carlos Castillo, Fernando Diaz, Sarah Vieweg. 2014. CrisisLex: A Lexicon for Collecting and Filtering Microblogged Communications in Crises. Abstract: 
 
 Locating timely, useful information during crises and mass emergencies is critical for those forced to make potentially life-altering decisions. As the use of Twitter to broadcast useful information during such situations becomes more widespread, the problem of finding it becomes more difficult. We describe an approach toward improving the recall in the sampling of Twitter communications that can lead to greater situational awareness during crisis situations. First, we create a lexicon of crisis-related terms that frequently appear in relevant messages posted during different types of crisis situations. Next, we demonstrate how we use the lexicon to automatically identify new terms that describe a given crisis. Finally, we explain how to efficiently query Twitter to extract crisis-related messages during emergency events. In our experiments, using a crisis lexicon leads to substantial improvements in terms of recall when added to a set of crisis-specific keywords manually chosen by experts; it also helps to preserve the original distribution of message types.

Abstract: Some online display advertisements are annoying. Although publishers know the payment they receive to run annoying ads, little is known about the cost that such ads incur (e.g., causing website abandonment). Across three empirical studies, the authors address two primary questions: (1) What is the economic cost of annoying ads to publishers? and (2) What is the cognitive impact of annoying ads to users? First, the authors conduct a preliminary study to identify sets of more and less annoying ads. Second, in a field experiment, they calculate the compensating differential, that is, the amount of money a publisher would need to pay users to generate the same number of impressions in the presence of annoying ads as it would generate in their absence. Third, the authors conduct a mouse-tracking study to investigate how annoying ads affect reading processes. They conclude that in plausible scenarios, the practice of running annoying ads can cost more money than it earns.

- Muhammad Imran, Carlos Castillo, Fernando Diaz, Sarah Vieweg. 2014. Processing Social Media Messages in Mass Emergency. Abstract: Social media platforms provide active communication channels during mass convergence and emergency events such as disasters caused by natural hazards. As a result, first responders, decision makers, and the public can use this information to gain insight into the situation as it unfolds. In particular, many social media messages communicated during emergencies convey timely, actionable information. Processing social media messages to obtain such information, however, involves solving multiple challenges including: parsing brief and informal messages, handling information overload, and prioritizing different types of information found in messages. These challenges can be mapped to classical information processing operations such as filtering, classifying, ranking, aggregating, extracting, and summarizing. We survey the state of the art regarding computational methods to process social media messages and highlight both their contributions and shortcomings. In addition, we examine their particularities, and methodically examine a series of key subproblems ranging from the detection of events to the creation of actionable and useful summaries. Research thus far has, to a large extent, produced methods to extract situational awareness information from social media. In this survey, we cover these various approaches, and highlight their benefits and shortcomings. We conclude with research challenges that go beyond situational awareness, and begin to look at supporting decision making and coordinating emergency-response actions.
- Hemant Purohit, Carlos Castillo, Fernando Diaz, A. Sheth, P. Meier. 2013. Emergency-relief coordination on social media: Automatically matching resource requests and offers. Abstract: Disaster affected communities are increasingly turning to social media for communication and coordination. This includes reports on needs (demands) and offers (supplies) of resources required during emergency situations. Identifying and matching such requests with potential responders can substantially accelerate emergency relief efforts. Current work of disaster management agencies is labor intensive, and there is substantial interest in automated tools.We present machine‚Äìlearning methods to automatically identify and match needs and offers communicated via social media for items and services such as shelter, money, clothing, etc. For instance, a message such as ‚Äúwe are coordinating a clothing/food drive for families affected by Hurricane Sandy. If you would like to donate, DM us‚Äù can be matched with a message such as ‚ÄúI got a bunch of clothes I‚Äôd like to donate to hurricane sandy victims. Anyone know where/how I can do that?‚Äù Compared to traditional search, our results can significantly improve the matchmaking efforts of disaster response agencies.

Abstract: In Web search and vertical search, recency ranking refers to retrieving and ranking documents by both relevance and freshness. As impoverished in-links and click information is the the biggest challenge for recency ranking, we advocate the use of Twitter data to address the challenge in this article. We propose a method to utilize Twitter TinyURL to detect fresh and high-quality documents, and leverage Twitter data to generate novel and effective features for ranking. The empirical experiments demonstrate that the proposed approach effectively improves a commercial search engine for both Web search ranking and tweet vertical ranking.
- J. Aslam, Matthew Ekstrand-Abueg, Virgil Pavlu, Fernando Diaz, T. Sakai. 2013. TREC 2013 Temporal Summarization. Abstract: Unexpected news events such as earthquakes or natural disasters represent a unique information access problem where traditional approaches fail. For example, immediately after an event, the corpus may be sparsely populated with relevant content. Even when, after a few hours, relevant content is available, it is often inaccurate or highly redundant. At the same time, crisis events demonstrate a scenario where users urgently need information, especially if they are directly affected by the event. The goal of this track is to develop systems for efficiently monitoring the information associated with an event over time. Specifically, we are interested in developing systems which (1) can broadcast short, relevant, and reliable sentence-length updates about a developing event and (2) can track the value of important event-related attributes (e.g. number of fatalities). The track has the following goals,
- Fernando Diaz, Ryen W. White, Georg Buscher, Daniel J. Liebling. 2013. Robust models of mouse movement on dynamic web search results pages. Abstract: Understanding how users examine result pages across a broad range of information needs is critical for search engine design. Cursor movements can be used to estimate visual attention on search engine results page (SERP) components, including traditional snippets, aggregated results, and advertisements. However, these signals can only be leveraged for SERPs where cursor tracking was enabled, limiting their utility for informing the design of new SERPs. In this work, we develop robust, log-based mouse movement models capable of estimating searcher attention on novel SERP arrangements. These models can help improve SERP design by anticipating searchers' engagement patterns given a proposed arrangement. We demonstrate the efficacy of our method using a large set of mouse-tracking data collected from two independent commercial search engines.

Abstract: Abstract : The goal of the TREC Web track is to explore and evaluate retrieval approaches over large-scale subsets of the Web -- currently on the order of one billion pages. For TREC 2013, the fifth year of the Web track, we implemented the following significant updates compared to 2012. First, the Diversity task was replaced with a new Risk-sensitive retrieval task that explores the tradeoffs systems can achieve between effectiveness (overall gains across queries) and robustness (minimizing the probability of significant failure, relative to a provided baseline). Second, we based the 2013 Web track experiments on the new ClueWeb12 collection created by the Language Technologies Institute at Carnegie Mellon University. ClueWeb12 is a successor to the ClueWeb09 dataset, comprising about one billion Web pages crawled between Feb-May 2012. The crawling and collection process for ClueWeb12 included a rich set of seed URLs based on commercial search traffic, Twitter and other sources, and multiple measures for flagging undesirable content such as spam, pornography, and malware. The Adhoc task continued as in previous years.

On the SPOT : Question Answering over Temporally Enhanced Structured Data. Abstract: We investigate the notion of temporal diversity, bringing together two recently active threads of research, namely temporal ranking and diversification of search results. A novel method is developed to determine search results consisting of documents that are relevant to the query and were published at diverse times of interest to the query. Preliminary experiments on twenty years‚Äô worth of newspaper articles from The New York Times demonstrate characteristics of our method and compare it against two baselines.

Abstract: Web content increasingly reflects the current state of the physical and social world, manifested both in traditional news media sources along with user-generated publishing sites such as Twitter, Foursquare, and Facebook. At the same time, web searching increasingly reflects problems grounded in the real world. As a result of this blending of the web with the real world, we observe that the web, both in its composition and use, has incorporated many of the dynamics of the real world. Few of the problems associated with searching dynamic collections are well understood, such as defining time-sensitive relevance, understanding user query behavior over time and understanding why certain web content changes. We believe that, just as static collections often benefit from modeling topics, dynamic collections will likely benefit from temporal modeling of events and time-sensitive user interests and intents, which were rarely addressed in the literature. There have been preliminary efforts in the research and industrial communities to address algorithms, architectures, evaluation methodologies and metrics. We aim to bring together practitioners and researchers to discuss their recent breakthroughs and the challenges with addressing time-aware information access, both from the algorithmic and the architectural perspectives. This workshop is a successor to the successful SIGIR 2012 Workshop on Time Aware Information Access (#TAIA2012). Where the 2012 edition was the first to bring together a broad set of academic and industrial researchers around the topic of time-aware information access, the specific focus of this workshop is on the many time-aware benchmarking activities that are ongoing in 2013.

Abstract: Microblogging sites such as Twitter can play a vital role in spreading information during ‚Äúnatural‚Äù or man-made disasters. But the volume and velocity of tweets posted during crises today tend to be extremely high, making it hard for disaster-affected communities and professional emergency responders to process the information in a timely manner. Furthermore, posts tend to vary highly in terms of their subjects and usefulness; from messages that are entirely off-topic or personal in nature, to messages containing critical information that augments situational awareness. Finding actionable information can accelerate disaster response and alleviate both property and human losses. In this paper, we describe automatic methods for extracting information from microblog posts. Specifically, we focus on extracting valuable ‚Äúinformation nuggets‚Äù, brief, self-contained information items relevant to disaster response. Our methods leverage machine learning methods for classifying posts and information extraction. Our results, validated over one large disaster-related dataset, reveal that a careful design can yield an effective system, paving the way for more sophisticated data analysis and visualization systems.

Abstract: During times of disasters online users generate a significant amount of data, some of which are extremely valuable for relief efforts. In this paper, we study the nature of social-media content generated during two different natural disasters. We also train a model based on conditional random fields to extract valuable information from such content. We evaluate our techniques over our two datasets through a set of carefully designed experiments. We also test our methods over a non-disaster dataset to show that our extraction model is useful for extracting information from socially-generated content in general.

Abstract: The World Wide Web is highly dynamic and is constantly evolving to cover the latest information about the physical and social updates in the world. At the same time, the changes in web contents are entangled with new information needs and time-sensitive user interactions with information sources. To address these temporal information needs effectively, it is essential for the search engines to model web dynamics and understand the changes in user behavior over time that are caused by them. In this full-day tutorial, we focus on modeling time-sensitive content on the web, and discuss the state-of-the-art approaches for integrating temporal signals in web search. We address many of the related research topics including those associated with searching dynamic collections, defining time-sensitive relevance, understanding user query behavior over time, and investigating the mains reasons behind content changes. We also cover algorithms, architectures, evaluation methodologies and metrics for time-aware search, and discuss the latest breakthroughs and open challenges, both from the algorithmic and the architectural perspectives.

Abstract: Proactive link suggestion leads to improved user experience by allowing users to reach relevant information with fewer clicks, fewer pages to read, or simply faster because the right pages are prefetched just in time. In this paper we tackle two new scenarios for link suggestion, which were not covered in prior work owing to scarcity of historical browsing data. In the web search scenario, we propose a method for generating quick links - additional entry points into Web sites, which are shown for top search results for navigational queries - for tail sites, for which little browsing statistics is available. Beyond Web search, we also propose a method for link suggestion in general web browsing, effectively anticipating the next link to be followed by the user. Our approach performs clustering of Web sites in order to aggregate information across multiple sites, and enables relevant link suggestion for virtually any site, including tail sites and brand new sites for which little historical data is available. Empirical evaluation confirms the validity of our method using editorially labeled data as well as real-life search and browsing data from a major US search engine.

Abstract: People nowadays can obtain information on current news events through media outlets, social media, and by actively seeking information using search engines. In this paper we investigate the temporal relationship between news coverage by media outlets, social media, and query logs and show that social media frequently precedes other information sources. Additionally, we demonstrate that there is strong negative correlation between the probability for reporting of an event and the distance of the information source from the event.
- Annie Louis, E. Crestan, Youssef Billawala, R. Shen, Fernando Diaz, Jean-Fran√ßois Crespo. 2011. Use of Query Similarity for Improving Presentation of News Verticals. Abstract: Users often issue web queries related to current news events. For such queries, it is useful to predict the news intent automatically and highlight the news documents on the search result page. An example query would be \election results" issued during the time of elections. These highlighted displays are called news verticals. Prior work has proposed several features for predicting whether a query has news intent. However, most approaches treat each query individually. So on a given day, very similar queries can be assigned opposite predictions. In our work, we explore how a system can utilize query similarity information to improve the quality of news verticals along two dimensions|prediction and presentation. We show via a study of actual search trac that the accuracy of predicting queries into newsworthy and not newsworthy categories can be improved using query similarity. Further, we present a method to identify a canonical variant for a newsworthy query such that using the canonical query would retrieve better results from the news backend to show in the display. Use of the canonical query also has the advantage of creating a consistent presentation of results for query variants related to the same news event.
- Jaime Arguello, Fernando Diaz, Jamie Callan. 2011. Learning to aggregate vertical results into web search results. Abstract: Aggregated search is the task of integrating results from potentially multiple specialized search services, or verticals, into the Web search results. The task requires predicting not only which verticals to present (the focus of most prior research), but also predicting where in the Web results to present them (i.e., above or below the Web results, or somewhere in between). Learning models to aggregate results from multiple verticals is associated with two major challenges. First, because verticals retrieve different types of results and address different search tasks, results from different verticals are associated with different types of predictive evidence (or features). Second, even when a feature is common across verticals, its predictiveness may be vertical-specific. Therefore, approaches to aggregating vertical results require handling an inconsistent feature representation across verticals, and, potentially, a vertical-specific relationship between features and relevance. We present 3 general approaches that address these challenges in different ways and compare their results across a set of 13 verticals and 1070 queries. We show that the best approaches are those that allow the learning algorithm to learn a vertical-specific relationship between features and relevance.
- E. Yom-Tov, Fernando Diaz. 2011. Out of sight, not out of mind: on the effect of social and physical detachment on information need. Abstract: The information needs of users and the documents which answer it are frequently contingent on the different characteristics of users. This is especially evident during natural disasters, such as earthquakes and violent weather incidents, which create a strong transient information need. In this paper we investigate how the information need of users is affected by their physical detachment, as estimated by their physical location in relation to that of the event, and by their social detachment, as quantified by the number of their acquaintances who may be affected by the event. Drawing on large-scale data from three major events, we show that social and physical detachment levels of users are a major influence on their information needs, as manifested by their search engine queries. We demonstrate how knowing social and physical detachment levels can assist in improving retrieval for two applications: identifying search queries related to events and ranking results in response to event-related queries. We find that the average precision in identifying relevant search queries improves by approximately 18%, and that the average precision of ranking that uses detachment information improves by 10%.
- Fernando Diaz, M. Lalmas, Milad Shokouhi. 2010. From federated to aggregated search. Abstract: Federated search refers to the brokered retrieval of content from a set of auxiliary retrieval systems instead of from a single, centralized retrieval system. Federated search tasks occur in, for example, digital libraries (where documents from several retrieval systems must be seamlessly merged) or peer-to-peer information retrieval (where documents distributed across a network of local indexes must be retrieved). In the context of web search, aggregated search refers to the integration of non-web content (e.g. images, videos, news articles, maps, tweets) into a web search result page. This is in contrast with classic web search where users are presented with a ranked list consisting exclusively of general web documents. As in other federated search situations, the non-web content is often retrieved from auxiliary retrieval systems (e.g. image or video databases, news indexes). Although aggregated search can be seen as an instance of federated search, several aspects make aggregated search a unique and compelling research topic. These include large sources of evidence (e.g. click logs) for deciding what non-web items to return, constrained interfaces (e.g. mobile screens), and a very heterogeneous set of available auxiliary resources (e.g. images, videos, maps, news articles). Each of these aspects introduces problems and opportunities not addressed in the federated search literature. Aggregated search is an important future research direction for information retrieval. All major search engines now provide aggregated search results. As the number of available auxiliary resources grows, deciding how to effectively surface content from each will become increasingly important. The goal of this tutorial is to provide an overview of federated search and aggregated search techniques for an intermediate information retrieval researcher. At the same time, the content will be valuable for practitioners in industry. We will take the audience through the most influential work in these areas and describe how they relate to real world aggregated search systems. We will also list some of the new challenges confronted in aggregated search and discuss directions for future work.

Abstract: Realtime web search refers to the retrieval of very fresh content which is in high demand. An effective portal web search engine must support a variety of search needs, including realtime web search. However, supporting realtime web search introduces two challenges not encountered in non-realtime web search: quickly crawling relevant content and ranking documents with impoverished link and click information. In this paper, we advocate the use of realtime micro-blogging data for addressing both of these problems. We propose a method to use the micro-blogging data stream to detect fresh URLs. We also use micro-blogging data to compute novel and effective features for ranking fresh URLs. We demonstrate these methods improve effective of the portal web search engine for realtime web search.
- Fernando Diaz, Donald Metzler, S. Amer-Yahia. 2010. Relevance and ranking in online dating systems. Abstract: Match-making systems refer to systems where users want to meet other individuals to satisfy some underlying need. Examples of match-making systems include dating services, resume/job bulletin boards, community based question answering, and consumer-to-consumer marketplaces. One fundamental component of a match-making system is the retrieval and ranking of candidate matches for a given user. We present the first in-depth study of information retrieval approaches applied to match-making systems. Specifically, we focus on retrieval for a dating service. This domain offers several unique problems not found in traditional information retrieval tasks. These include two-sided relevance, very subjective relevance, extremely few relevant matches, and structured queries. We propose a machine learned ranking function that makes use of features extracted from the uniquely rich user profiles that consist of both structured and unstructured attributes. An extensive evaluation carried out using data gathered from a real online dating service shows the benefits of our proposed methodology with respect to traditional match-making baseline systems. Our analysis also provides deep insights into the aspects of match-making that are particularly important for producing highly relevant matches.

Abstract: In web search, recency ranking refers to ranking documents by relevance which takes freshness into account. In this paper, we propose a retrieval system which automatically detects and responds to recency sensitive queries. The system detects recency sensitive queries using a high precision classifier. The system responds to recency sensitive queries by using a machine learned ranking model trained for such queries. We use multiple recency features to provide temporal evidence which effectively represents document recency. Furthermore, we propose several training methodologies important for training recency sensitive rankers. Finally, we develop new evaluation metrics for recency sensitive queries. Our experiments demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed approaches.

Abstract: Vertical aggregation is the task of incorporating results from specialized search engines or verticals (e.g., images, video, news) into Web search results. Vertical selection is the subtask of deciding, given a query, which verticals, if any, are relevant. State of the art approaches use machine learned models to predict which verticals are relevant to a query. When trained using a large set of labeled data, a machine learned vertical selection model outperforms baselines which require no training data. Unfortunately, whenever a new vertical is introduced, a costly new set of editorial data must be gathered. In this paper, we propose methods for reusing training data from a set of existing (source) verticals to learn a predictive model for a new (target) vertical. We study methods for learning robust, portable, and adaptive cross-vertical models. Experiments show the need to focus on different types of features when maximizing portability (the ability for a single model to make accurate predictions across multiple verticals) than when maximizing adaptability (the ability for a single model to make accurate predictions for a specific vertical). We demonstrate the efficacy of our methods through extensive experimentation for 11 verticals

However, manually labeled training data (with multiple absolute grades) has become the bottleneck for training a quality ranking function, particularly for a new domain. In this paper, we explore the adaptation of machine-learned ranking models across a set of geographically diverse markets with the market-specific pairwise preference data, which can be easily obtained from clickthrough logs. We propose a novel adaptation algorithm, Pairwise-Trada, which is able to adapt ranking models that are trained with multi-grade labeled training data to the target market using the target-market-specific pair-wise preference data. We present results demonstrating the efficacy of our technique on a set of commercial search engine data.
- Ahmed Hassan Awadallah, R. Jones, Fernando Diaz. 2009. A case study of using geographic cues to predict query news intent. Abstract: Geographic information retrieval encompasses important tasks including finding the location of a user, and locations relevant to their search queries. Web-based search engines receive queries from numerous users located in very different parts of the world. A typical way for people to find news is through a general web search engine, which makes it important for search engines to recognize queries with news intent. An important question for geographic information retrieval is how we can benefit from geographic cues to predict the intent of users. This work presents a case study of an application using geographic features to improve the quality of an important web search task, involving predicting which queries have news intent and hence are likely to receive clicks on news search results. Our case study suggests that information derived from geographic features can help the task. The information we consider includes cues derived from the location of the user, from the IP address, the location relevant to the query, automatically extracted from the query string, and the relation between the two locations. We build a classifier that uses geographical cues to predict whether a query will result in a news click or not. We compare our classifier to a strong baseline that use non-geographic click-based features and we show that our classifier outperforms the baseline for geographic queries.
- Fernando Diaz. 2009. Integration of news content into web results. Abstract: Aggregated search refers to the integration of content from specialized corpora or verticals into web search results. Aggregation improves search when the user has vertical intent but may not be aware of or desire vertical search. In this paper, we address the issue of integrating search results from a news vertical into web search results. News is particularly challenging because, given a query, the appropriate decision---to integrate news content or not---changes with time. Our system adapts to news intent in two ways. First, by inspecting the dynamics of the news collection and query volume, we can track development of and interest in topics. Second, by using click feedback, we can quickly recover from system errors. We define several click-based metrics which allow a system to be monitored and tuned without annotator effort.
- Jaime Arguello, Fernando Diaz, Jamie Callan, Jean-Fran√ßois Crespo. 2009. Sources of evidence for vertical selection. Abstract: Web search providers often include search services for domain-specific subcollections, called verticals, such as news, images, videos, job postings, company summaries, and artist profiles. We address the problem of vertical selection, predicting relevant verticals (if any) for queries issued to the search engine's main web search page. In contrast to prior query classification and resource selection tasks, vertical selection is associated with unique resources that can inform the classification decision. We focus on three sources of evidence: (1) the query string, from which features are derived independent of external resources, (2) logs of queries previously issued directly to the vertical, and (3) corpora representative of vertical content. We focus on 18 different verticals, which differ in terms of semantics, media type, size, and level of query traffic. We compare our method to prior work in federated search and retrieval effectiveness prediction. An in-depth error analysis reveals unique challenges across different verticals and provides insight into vertical selection for future work.
- Jaime Arguello, Jamie Callan, Fernando Diaz. 2009. Classification-based resource selection. Abstract: In some retrieval situations, a system must search across multiple collections. This task, referred to as federated search, occurs for example when searching a distributed index or aggregating content for web search. Resource selection refers to the subtask of deciding, given a query, which collections to search. Most existing resource selection methods rely on evidence found in collection content. We present an approach to resource selection that combines multiple sources of evidence to inform the selection decision. We derive evidence from three different sources: collection documents, the topic of the query, and query click-through data. We combine this evidence by treating resource selection as a multiclass machine learning problem. Although machine learned approaches often require large amounts of manually generated training data, we present a method for using automatically generated training data. We make use of and compare against prior resource selection work and evaluate across three experimental testbeds.
- Fernando Diaz, Jaime Arguello. 2009. Adaptation of offline vertical selection predictions in the presence of user feedback. Abstract: Web search results often integrate content from specialized corpora known as verticals. Given a query, one important aspect of aggregated search is the selection of relevant verticals from a set of candidate verticals. One drawback to previous approaches to vertical selection is that methods have not explicitly modeled user feedback. However, production search systems often record a variety of feedback information. In this paper, we present algorithms for vertical selection which adapt to user feedback. We evaluate algorithms using a novel simulator which models performance of a vertical selector situated in realistic query traffic.

- J. Allan, Fernando Diaz. 2008. Autocorrelation and regularization of query-based information retrieval scores. Abstract: Query-based information retrieval refers to the process of scoring documents given a short natural language query. Query-based information retrieval systems have been developed to support searching diverse collections such as the world wide web, personal email archives, news corpora, and legal collections. This thesis is motivated by one of the tenets of information retrieval: the cluster hypothesis. We define a design principle based on the cluster hypothesis which states that retrieval scores should be locally consistent. We refer to this design principle as score autocorrelation. Our experiments show that the degree to which retrieval scores satisfy this design principle correlates positively with system performance. We use this result to define a general, black box method for improving the local consistency of a set of retrieval scores. We refer to this process as local score regularization. We demonstrate that regularization consistently and significantly improves retrieval performance for a wide variety of baseline algorithms. Regularization is closely related to classic techniques such as pseudo-relevance feedback and cluster-based retrieval. We demonstrate that the effectiveness of these techniques may be explained by their regularizing behavior. We argue that regularization should be adopted either as a generic post-processing step or as a fundamental design principle for retrieval models.
- R. Jones, Ahmed Hassan Awadallah, Fernando Diaz. 2008. Geographic features in web search retrieval. Abstract: We conduct large-scale search engine relevance experiments, using the 12% of queries that contain placenames, matching the placenames to places in the documents, and examining the impact of geographic features on web retrieval relevance. Specifically we examine distance between query and document place-names mentioned, noting that when a document has multiple places (which we observe in 82% of documents) we must choose a function over those multiple places. We find that the minimum distance between the document locations and query location is the strongest geographical predictor of document relevance, and that combining geographic features with text features gives us a 5% improvement in relevance over using text features alone.
- R. Jones, Fernando Diaz. 2007. Temporal profiles of queries. Abstract: Documents with timestamps, such as email and news, can be placed along a timeline. The timeline for a set of documents returned in response to a query gives an indication of how documents relevant to that query are distributed in time. Examining the timeline of a query result set allows us to characterize both how temporally dependent the topic is, as well as how relevant the results are likely to be. We outline characteristic patterns in query result set timelines, and show experimentally that we can automatically classify documents into these classes. We also show that properties of the query result set timeline can help predict the mean average precision of a query. These results show that meta-features associated with a query can be combined with text retrieval techniques to improve our understanding and treatment of text search on documents with timestamps.
- Fernando Diaz. 2007. Performance prediction using spatial autocorrelation. Abstract: Evaluation of information retrieval systems is one of the core tasks in information retrieval. Problems include the inability to exhaustively label all documents for a topic, generalizability from a small number of topics, and incorporating the variability of retrieval systems. Previous work addresses the evaluation of systems, the ranking of queries by difficulty, and the ranking of individual retrievals by performance. Approaches exist for the case of few and even no relevance judgments. Our focus is on zero-judgment performance prediction of individual retrievals. One common shortcoming of previous techniques is the assumption of uncorrelated document scores and judgments. If documents are embedded in a high-dimensional space (as they often are), we can apply techniques from spatial data analysis to detect correlations between document scores. We find that the low correlation between scores of topically close documents often implies a poor retrieval performance. When compared to a state of the art baseline, we demonstrate that the spatial analysis of retrieval scores provides significantly better prediction performance. These new predictors can also be incorporated with classic predictors to improve performance further. We also describe the first large-scale experiment to evaluate zero-judgment performance prediction for a massive number of retrieval systems over a variety collections in several languages.
- Fernando Diaz, Donald Metzler. 2007. Pseudo-Aligned Multilingual Corpora. Abstract: In machine translation, document alignment refers to finding correspondences between documents which are exact translations of each other. We define pseudo-alignment as the task of finding topical--as opposed to exact--correspondences between documents in different languages. We apply semisupervised methods to pseudo-align multilingual corpora. Specifically, we construct a topic-based graph for each language. Then, given exact correspondences between a subset of documents, we project the unaligned documents into a shared lower-dimensional space. We demonstrate that close documents in this lower-dimensional space tend to share the same topic. This has applications in machine translation and cross-lingual information analysis. Experimental results show that pseudo-alignment of multilingual corpora is feasible and that the document alignments produced are qualitatively sound. Our technique requires no linguistic knowledge of the corpus. On average when 10% of the corpus consists of exact correspondences, an on-topic correspondence occurs within the top 5 foreign neighbors in the lower-dimensional space while the exact correspondence occurs within the top 10 foreign neighbors in this this space. We also show how to substantially improve these results with a novel method for incorporating language-independent information.
- Fernando Diaz, Donald Metzler. 2006. Improving the estimation of relevance models using large external corpora. Abstract: Information retrieval algorithms leverage various collection statistics to improve performance. Because these statistics are often computed on a relatively small evaluation corpus, we believe using larger, non-evaluation corpora should improve performance. Specifically, we advocate incorporating external corpora based on language modeling. We refer to this process as external expansion. When compared to traditional pseudo-relevance feedback techniques, external expansion is more stable across topics and up to 10% more effective in terms of mean average precision. Our results show that using a high quality corpus that is comparable to the evaluation corpus can be as, if not more, effective than using the web. Our results also show that external expansion outperforms simulated relevance feedback. In addition, we propose a method for predicting the extent to which external expansion will improve retrieval performance. Our new measure demonstrates positive correlation with improvements in mean average precision.
- Fernando Diaz. 2005. Regularizing ad hoc retrieval scores. Abstract: The cluster hypothesis states: closely related documents tend to be relevant to the same request. We exploit this hypothesis directly by adjusting ad hoc retrieval scores from an initial retrieval so that topically related documents receive similar scores. We refer to this process as score regularization. Score regularization can be presented as an optimization problem, allowing the use of results from semi-supervised learning. We demonstrate that regularized scores consistently and significantly rank documents better than unregularized scores, given a variety of initial retrieval algorithms. We evaluate our method on two large corpora across a substantial number of topics.

UMass at TREC 2004: Notebook. Abstract: 1 Terabyte 1.1 Model The retrieval model implemented in the Indri search engine is an enhanced version of the model described in [30], which combines the language modeling [35] and inference network [38] approaches to information retrieval. The resulting model allows structured queries similar to those used in INQUERY [4] to be evaluated using language modeling estimates within the network, rather than tf.idf estimates. Figure 1.1 shows a graphical model representation of the network. As in the original inference network framework, documents are ranked according to P (I|D,Œ±, Œ≤), the belief the information need I is met given document D and hyperparameters Œ± and Œ≤ as evidence. Due to space limitations, a general understanding of the inference network framework is assumed. See [30] and [38] to fill in any missing details.
- N. A. Jaleel, James Allan, W. Bruce Croft, Fernando Diaz, L. Larkey, Xiaoyan Li, Mark D. Smucker, C. Wade. 2004. UMass at TREC 2004: Novelty and HARD. Abstract: For the TREC 2004 Novelty track, UMass participated in all four tasks. Although finding relevant sentences was harder this year than last, we continue to show marked improvements over the baseline of calling all sentences relevant, with a variant of tfidf being the most successful approach. We achieve 5‚Äê9% improvements over the baseline in locating novel sentences, primarily by looking at the similarity of a sentence to earlier sentences and focusing on named entities. For the High Accuracy Retrieval from Documents (HARD) track, we investigated the use of clarification forms, fixed- and variable-length passage retrieval, and the use of metadata. Clarification form results indicate that passage level feedback can provide improvements comparable to user supplied related-text for document evaluation and outperforms related-text for passage evaluation. Document retrieval methods without a query expansion component show the most gains from related-text. We also found that displaying the top passages for feedback outperformed displaying centroid passages. Named entity feedback resulted in mixed performance. Our primary findings for passage retrieval are that document retrieval methods performed better than passage retrieval methods on the passage evaluation metric of binary preference at 12,000 characters, and that clarification forms improved passage retrieval for every retrieval method explored. We found no benefit to using variable-length passages over fixed-length passages for this corpus. Our use of geography and genre metadata resulted in no significant changes in retrieval performance.
- Fernando Diaz, R. Jones. 2004. Using temporal profiles of queries for precision prediction. Abstract: A key missing component in information retrieval systems is self-diagnostic tests to establish whether the system can provide reasonable results for a given query on a document collection. If we can measure properties of a retrieved set of documents which allow us to predict average precision, we can automate the decision of whether to elicit relevance feedback, or modify the retrieval system in other ways. We use meta-data attached to documents in the form of time stamps to measure the distribution of documents retrieved in response to a query, over the time domain, to create a temporal profile for a query. We define some useful features over this temporal profile. We find that using these temporal features, together with the content of the documents retrieved, we can improve the prediction of average precision for a query.

An overview of the special issue. Abstract: This special issue is devoted to the concept of Industrial Ecology, which has engendered both excitement and criticism in its claim of providing a new unifying principle for operationalizing sustainable development. This volume explores the history and evolution of the concept; its various meanings; methodologies for its operationalization; its relationship to pollution control, pollution prevention, and accident prevention; and finally, its relationship with biological ecosystems. Suren Erkman provides a useful and brief history of industrial ecology, tracing its multi-nation origins as far back as 1970 or even 1955. He argues that it is a more expansive concept than either pollution control or pollution prevention-and, in fact, encompasses and integrates both into new management practices-a point others would disagree with. Erkman sees industrial ecology as correcting the ‚Äòdisconnect‚Äô of industrial systems with the ecosystem, and with each other. He cites the important work of Robert Ayres on tracking materials Aows and promoting increased recovery/recovery/se, and credits Robert Frosch and Nicholas Gallopoulos with reviving and propelling the concept into prominence with their classic 1989 article in Scientific American, emphasizing ‚Äòindustrial metabolism‚Äô while acknowledging the imperfectness of industrial ecosystems to completely mimic the biological ecosystem and eliminate all adverse environmental effects. The author acknowledges Chihiro Watanabe‚Äôs work in Japan which is ‚Äòthe only country where ideas on industrial ecology were ever taken seriously and put into practice on a large scale. . .‚Äô Finally, Erkman sees the evolution of industrial ecology into two main directions: (1) eco-industrial parks and islands of sustainability and (2) dematerialization, decarbonization,

Abstract: Traditional information retrieval systems have ignored the potential improvement in precision provided by personalization. We present a study of the behavior and evaluation of personalized information retrieval systems.

Although performance is mixed, results point to the need to develop other algorithms within this evaluation framework.
- Fernando Diaz. 2002. Using wearable computers to construct semantic representations of physical spaces. Abstract: The representation of physical space has traditionally focused on keyphrases such as "Computer Science Building" or "Physics Department" that help us in describing and navigating physical spaces. However, such keyphrases do not capture many properties of physical space. As with the assignment of a keyword to describe a piece of text, these constructs sacrifice meaningful information for abstraction. We propose a system of spatial representation based on richer emergent language models that encode information lost in keyphrase approaches. We use a mix of wearable and ubiquitous computing environments for the construction of these models. Wearable computers infer language models of their hosts. These language models then act as semantic paint over spaces in a ubiquitous computing environment. Spaces collect this information and construct representations based on interactions with augmented humans. A prototype navigation system based on this theory is presented and compared to traditional representations.
