Abstract: We have developed a reactive oxygen species (ROS) sensor based on nanopores modified with GGGCEG(GPGGA)4CEG. The formation of an intramolecular disulfide bond oxidized by ROS leads to conformation changes in GGGCEG(GPGGA)4CEG, which then induces an obvious change in the size of the nanopores and a corresponding ionic current change. This work allows the accurate and dynamic monitoring of ROS through the combination of (GPGGA)4 and nanopores.

Abstract: Graph-based diffusion models have shown promising results in terms of generating high-quality solutions to NP-complete (NPC) combinatorial optimization (CO) problems. However, those models are often inefficient in inference, due to the iterative evaluation nature of the denoising diffusion process. This paper proposes to use progressive distillation to speed up the inference by taking fewer steps (e.g., forecasting two steps ahead within a single step) during the denoising process. Our experimental results show that the progressively distilled model can perform inference 16 times faster with only 0.019% degradation in performance on the TSP-50 dataset.

High CD8+tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes indicate severe exhaustion and poor prognosis in angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma. Abstract: Background Exhaustion of CD8+ tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs), characterized by the overexpression of immune checkpoints (IC), is a major impediment to anti-tumor immunity. However, the exhaustion status of CD8+TILs in angioimmunoblastic T cell lymphoma (AITL) remains unclear. Therefore, we aimed to elucidate the exhaustion status of CD8+TILs in AITL and its influence on prognosis. Methods The correlation between CD8+TILs and IC expression in AITL was analyzed using single-cell RNA sequencing (n = 2), flow cytometry (n = 20), and RNA sequencing (n = 20). Biological changes related to CD8+TILs exhaustion at different cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) levels (mean expression levels of CD8A, CD8B, GZMA, GZMB, and PRF1) in AITL were evaluated using RNA sequencing (n = 20) and further validated using the GEO dataset (n = 51). The impact of CD8 protein expression and CTL levels on patient prognosis was analyzed using flow cytometry and RNA sequencing, respectively. Results Our findings demonstrated that the higher the infiltration of CD8+TILs, the higher was the proportion of exhausted CD8+TILs characterized by the overexpression of multiple IC. This was accompanied by extensive exhaustion-related biological changes, which suggested severe exhaustion in CD8+TILs and may be one of the main reasons for the poor prognosis of patients with high CD8+TILs and CTL. Conclusion Our study comprehensively reveals the exhaustion status of CD8+TILs and their potential negative impact on AITL prognosis, which facilitates further mechanistic studies and is valuable for guiding immunotherapy strategies.

Abstract: Near-infrared and visible face recognition (NIR-VIS) is attracting increasing attention because of the need to achieve face recognition in low-light conditions to enable 24-hour secure retrieval. However, annotating identity labels for a large number of heterogeneous face images is time-consuming and expensive, which limits the application of the NIR-VIS face recognition system to larger scale real-world scenarios. In this paper, we attempt to achieve NIR-VIS face recognition in an unsupervised domain adaptation manner. To get rid of the reliance on manual annotations, we propose a novel Robust cross-domain Pseudo-labeling and Contrastive learning (RPC) network which consists of three key components, i.e., NIR cluster-based Pseudo labels Sharing (NPS), Domain-specific cluster Contrastive Learning (DCL) and Inter-domain cluster Contrastive Learning (ICL). Firstly, NPS is presented to generate pseudo labels by exploring robust NIR clusters and sharing reliable label knowledge with VIS domain. Secondly, DCL is designed to learn intra-domain compact yet discriminative representations. Finally, ICL dynamically combines and refines intrinsic identity relationships to guide the instance-level features to learn robust and domain-independent representations. Extensive experiments are conducted to verify an accuracy of over 99% in pseudo label assignment and the advanced performance of RPC network on four mainstream NIR-VIS datasets.

Abstract: The fatigue crack propagation behaviour of Q550E high-performance steel (HPS) is studied in this paper. Static tensile testing and fatigue crack propagation testing were carried out, and the results were compared with those of Q235. Finite element models were developed and verified against the experimental results. The impacts of the initial crack angle, crack depth ratio, stress ratio, thickness, and corrosion pitting on the fatigue crack propagation behaviour of the HPS were analysed. The results show that the fatigue life of Q550 was reduced by 18% due to the corrosion pitting, but it did not change the crack propagation path. When the stress intensity factor is higher than a certain value, the fatigue performance of Q235 is better than that of Q550E. The initial crack angle of 52.5° is the critical angle of the crack stress intensity factor. The steel tends to fracture as the crack depth ratio increases, and more attention should be paid to the effective crack length in engineering practice. An increasing stress ratio leads to a smaller stress intensity factor, and the thickness affects the stress intensity factor in the later stage. The crack stress intensity factor around the corrosion pits gradually decreases along the thickness direction, and the crack tips around the corrosion pits tend to reach the yield state initially, accelerating the fatigue fracture of the specimen and ultimately leading to a decrease in fatigue life.

Abstract: Compared to the charge–charge interaction, the role of the dipole‐dipole interaction has long been ignored in the phase behaviors of charged macromolecules in solutions. Charged macromolecules in solutions exhibit rich phase behaviors due to their complexity and they have been studied extensively. Phase separation can happen for charged macromolecules in the presence of monovalent salt, multivalent salt, and oppositely charged polymers, surfactants, etc., and for more advanced charged macromolecules such as polyzwitterions and polyampholytes, the phase diagram is even richer. In this perspective, the unacknowledged role of dipole‐dipole interaction in the phase behaviors of charged macromolecular solutions will be introduced. Dipolar polymers can form complex, self‐regulating structures which can be employed in various fields from drug‐delivery systems to next‐generation polymers. More importantly, it will shed light on how some of the life's basic and coherent structures such as biomolecular condensates and membrane‐less organelles are assembled and built by charged biomacromolecules such as DNA, RNA, and proteins.

Analysis of Volatile Components in Dried Fruits and Branch Exudates of Schisandra chinensis with Different Fruit Colors Using GC-IMS Technology. Abstract: To investigate the volatile components of Schisandra chinensis (Turcz.) Bail (commonly known as northern Schisandra) of different colors and to explore their similarities and differences, to identify the main flavor substances in the volatile components of the branch exudates of northern schisandra, and finally to establish a fingerprint map of the volatile components of the dried fruits and branch exudates of northern Schisandra of different colors, we used GC-IMS technology to analyze the volatile components of the dried fruits and branch exudates of three different colors of northern Schisandra and established a fingerprint spectra. The results showed that a total of 60 different volatile chemical components were identified in the branch exudates and dried fruits of Schisandra. The components of germplasm resources with different fruit colors were significantly different. The ion mobility spectrum and OPLS-DA results showed that white and yellow fruits were more similar compared to red fruits. The volatile components in dried fruits were significantly higher than those in branch exudates. After VIP (variable importance in projection) screening, 41 key volatile substances in dried fruits and 30 key volatile substances in branch exudates were obtained. After screening by odor activity value (OAV), there were 24 volatile components greater than 1 in both dried fruits and branch exudates. The most important contributing volatile substance was 3-methyl-butanal, and the most important contributing volatile substance in white fruit was (E)-2-hexenal.

Secreted endogenous macrosomes reduce Aβ burden and ameliorate Alzheimer’s disease. Abstract: Innovative therapeutic strategies are urgently needed for Alzheimer’s disease (AD) due to the increasing size of the aging population and the lack of effective drug treatment. Here, we report the therapeutic effects of extracellular vesicles (EVs) secreted by microglia, including macrosomes and small EVs, on AD-associated pathology. Macrosomes strongly inhibited β-amyloid (Aβ) aggregation and rescued cells from Aβ misfolding–induced cytotoxicity. Furthermore, macrosome administration reduced Aβ plaques and ameliorated cognitive impairment in mice with AD. In contrast, small EVs slightly promoted Aβ aggregation and did not improve AD pathology. Proteomic analysis of small EVs and macrosomes revealed that macrosomes harbor several important neuroprotective proteins that inhibit Aβ misfolding. In particular, the small integral membrane protein 10–like protein 2B in macrosomes has been shown to inhibit Aβ aggregation. Our observations provide an alternative therapeutic strategy for the treatment of AD over conventional ineffective drug treatments.

Abstract: To meet the strong demand for deploying face recognition systems in low-light scenarios, the Near-InfraRed and VISible (NIR-VIS) face recognition task is receiving increasing attention. However, heterogeneous faces have the characteristics of heterogeneity and non-neutrality. Heterogeneity refers to the fact that the matching images are in different modalities, and non-neutrality means that the matching images are significantly different in pose, expression, lighting, etc. Both situations pose challenges for NIR-VIS face matching. To address this problem, we propose a novel Neutral face Learning and Progressive Fusion synthesis (NLPF) network to disentangle the latent attributes of heterogeneous faces and learn neutral face representations. Our approach naturally integrates Identity-related Neutral face Learning (INL) and Attribute Progressive Fusion (APF) into a joint framework. Firstly, INL eliminates modal variations and residual variations by guiding the network to learn homogeneous neutral face feature representations, which tackles the challenge of heterogeneity and non-neutrality by mapping cross-modal images to a common neutral representation subspace. Besides, APF is presented to perform the disentanglement and reintegration of identity-related features, modality-related features and residual features in a progressive fusion manner, which helps to further purify identity-related features. Comprehensive evaluations are carried out on three mainstream NIR-VIS datasets to verify the robustness and effectiveness of the NLPF model. In particular, NLPF has competitive recognition performance on LAMP-HQ, the most challenging NIR-VIS dataset so far.

Abstract: Neural network-based Combinatorial Optimization (CO) methods have shown promising results in solving various NP-complete (NPC) problems without relying on hand-crafted domain knowledge. This paper broadens the current scope of neural solvers for NPC problems by introducing a new graph-based diffusion framework, namely DIFUSCO. Our framework casts NPC problems as discrete {0, 1}-vector optimization problems and leverages graph-based denoising diffusion models to generate high-quality solutions. We investigate two types of diffusion models with Gaussian and Bernoulli noise, respectively, and devise an effective inference schedule to enhance the solution quality. We evaluate our methods on two well-studied NPC combinatorial optimization problems: Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) and Maximal Independent Set (MIS). Experimental results show that DIFUSCO strongly outperforms the previous state-of-the-art neural solvers, improving the performance gap between ground-truth and neural solvers from 1.76% to 0.46% on TSP-500, from 2.46% to 1.17% on TSP-1000, and from 3.19% to 2.58% on TSP10000. For the MIS problem, DIFUSCO outperforms the previous state-of-the-art neural solver on the challenging SATLIB benchmark.

Abstract: Two groups of Al and Ti–Mg complex deoxidized steels with different S contents are designed, and inclusion characteristics of two groups of steel samples are observed by field‐emission scanning electron microscopy–energy‐dispersive spectroscopy. The results show that there are single TiS inclusions, MgAl2O4 (Al2O3)–TiS, and MgAl2O4–TiN–TiS complex inclusions in No. 1 steel (low‐sulfur content) and No. 2 steel (high‐sulfur content). However, there are also complex inclusions containing MnS in the No. 2 steel but not in No. 1 steel. In order to reveal the precipitation mechanism of MnS, equilibrium phase of inclusion from 1873 K to liquidus temperature is further analyzed, and the mass fractions of different inclusions from liquidus to solidus temperature are quantitatively calculated using the element segregation model combined with FactSage 7.2 thermodynamic software. Furthermore, the mismatch values between different crystal planes of MnS, TiS, and TiN are calculated. The results show that MnS (110) is most likely to precipitate on TiS (001), which is consistent with the observation that there is TiS–MnS interface in the complex inclusions containing MnS in No. 2 steel. This study could be helpful to the controlling sulfide precipitation in Al and Ti–Mg complex deoxidized steel.

Abstract: Goal-Conditioned Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning (GCHRL) is a promising paradigm to address the exploration-exploitation dilemma in reinforcement learning. It decomposes the source task into sub goal conditional subtasks and conducts exploration and exploitation in the subgoal space. The effectiveness of GCHRL heavily relies on sub goal representation functions and sub goal selection strategy. However, existing works often overlook the temporal coherence in GCHRL when learning latent sub goal representations and lack an efficient sub goal selection strategy that balances exploration and exploitation. This paper proposes HIerarchical reinforcement learning via dynamically building Latent Landmark graphs (HILL) to overcome these limitations. HILL learns latent subgoal representations that satisfy temporal coherence using a contrastive representation learning objective. Based on these representations, HILL dynamically builds latent landmark graphs and employs a novelty measure on nodes and a utility measure on edges. Finally, HILL develops a subgoal selection strategy that balances exploration and exploitation by jointly considering both measures. Experimental results demonstrate that HILL outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on continuous control tasks with sparse rewards in sample efficiency and asymptotic performance.

Aligning Large Multimodal Models with Factually Augmented RLHF. Abstract: Large Multimodal Models (LMM) are built across modalities and the misalignment between two modalities can result in"hallucination", generating textual outputs that are not grounded by the multimodal information in context. To address the multimodal misalignment issue, we adapt the Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) from the text domain to the task of vision-language alignment, where human annotators are asked to compare two responses and pinpoint the more hallucinated one, and the vision-language model is trained to maximize the simulated human rewards. We propose a new alignment algorithm called Factually Augmented RLHF that augments the reward model with additional factual information such as image captions and ground-truth multi-choice options, which alleviates the reward hacking phenomenon in RLHF and further improves the performance. We also enhance the GPT-4-generated training data (for vision instruction tuning) with previously available human-written image-text pairs to improve the general capabilities of our model. To evaluate the proposed approach in real-world scenarios, we develop a new evaluation benchmark MMHAL-BENCH with a special focus on penalizing hallucinations. As the first LMM trained with RLHF, our approach achieves remarkable improvement on the LLaVA-Bench dataset with the 94% performance level of the text-only GPT-4 (while previous best methods can only achieve the 87% level), and an improvement by 60% on MMHAL-BENCH over other baselines. We opensource our code, model, data at https://llava-rlhf.github.io.

Abstract: To overcome the technical bottleneck of face recognition in low-light scenarios, Near-InfraRed and VISible (NIR-VIS) heterogeneous face recognition is proposed for matching well-lit VIS faces with poorly lit NIR faces. Current cross-modal synthesis methods visually convert the NIR modality to the VIS modality and then perform face matching in the VIS modality. However, using a heavyweight GAN network on unpaired NIR-VIS faces may lead to high synthesis difficulty, low inference efficiency, and other problems. To alleviate the above problems, we simultaneously synthesize NIR and VIS images into modality-independent syncretic images and propose a novel syncretic space learning (SSL) model to eliminate the modal gap. First, Syncretic Modality Generator (SMG) synthesizes NIR and VIS images into syncretic images using channel-level convolution with a shallow CNN. In particular, the discriminative structural information is well preserved and the face quality can be further improved with small modal variations in a self-supervised learning manner. Second, Modality-adversarial Syncretic space Learning (MSL) projects NIR and VIS images into the syncretic space by a syncretic-modality adversarial learning strategy with syncretic pattern guided objective, so the modal gap of NIR-VIS faces can be effectively reduced. Finally, the Syncretic Distribution Consistency (SDC) constructed by NIR-syncretic, syncretic-syncretic, and VIS-syncretic consistency can enhance the intra-class compactness and learn discriminative representations. Extensive experiments on three challenging datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the SSL method.

Abstract: To understand the secondary transfer performances of residual prestress after the anchoring failure of end-anchored steel wire strands due to corrosion fracture, six steel wire strand components of post-tensioning prestress were designed and fabricated. One-side fast corrosion was applied to the steel wire strand components using the electrochemical method until anchoring failure was reached. The sphere of influence, stress changes, and the retraction and swelling effect of broken beams after failure were investigated. The influences of factors such as concrete strength, stirrup area, and the length of the component on the secondary transfer length of residual prestress were discussed. Based on the deformation relationship between prestressed steel wire strands and concrete in the stress transfer zone, a stress equation was established and solved through a bond constitutive model. A prediction model of the effective stress transfer length of prestressed steel wire strand after failure was proposed. The results demonstrated that residual prestress can have a secondary transfer after the corrosion fracture of end-anchored steel wire strands, but some effective prestress may be lost. Moreover, the loss of prestress is inversely proportional to concrete compressive strength. When the specimens are relatively short, the prestress loss increases significantly. Concrete strength has significant influences on the length of secondary transfer. The proposed simplified calculation method of the secondary transfer length of residual prestress has a relatively high accuracy, with an average error of 2.9% and a maximum error of 5.2%.

Abstract: Due to the effect of higher harmonics on magnetic properties under actual complex operating conditions, the accurate calculation of core losses of soft magnetic composites (SMC) is complicated. First, this paper improves the existing SMC model by introducing a correction factor to correct the hysteresis loss coefficient so that the model can consider the local variation characteristics of the magnetic density waveform and then calculate the core loss under different harmonic excitation. Then, the influence of skin effect and inhomogeneous flux density within the ring sample model is analyzed. Finally, to validate the improved model, it is compared with other models in the reference based on experimental measurements, respectively. The results show that the core loss calculated by the improved model is closer to the experimental results under different harmonic excitations. In addition, the applicability of the improved SMC model under triangular and square wave excitations is also verified by the derivation of the equations.

MRI Features for Predicting Microvascular Invasion and Postoperative Recurrence in Hepatocellular Carcinoma Without Peritumoral Hypointensity. Abstract: Purpose To identify MRI features of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) that predict microvascular invasion (MVI) and postoperative intrahepatic recurrence in patients without peritumoral hepatobiliary phase (HBP) hypointensity. Patients and Methods One hundred and thirty patients with HCC who underwent preoperative gadoxetate-enhanced MRI and curative hepatic resection were retrospectively reviewed. Two radiologists reviewed all preoperative MR images and assessed the radiological features of HCCs. The ability of peritumoral HBP hypointensity to identify MVI and intrahepatic recurrence was analyzed. We then assessed the MRI features of HCC that predicted the MVI and intrahepatic recurrence-free survival (RFS) in the subgroup without peritumoral HBP hypointensity. Finally, a two-step flowchart was constructed to assist in clinical decision-making. Results Peritumoral HBP hypointensity (odds ratio, 3.019; 95% confidence interval: 1.071–8.512; P=0.037) was an independent predictor of MVI. The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, and AUROC of peritumoral HBP hypointensity in predicting MVI were 23.80%, 91.04%, 71.23%, 55.96%, and 0.574, respectively. Intrahepatic RFS was significantly shorter in patients with peritumoral HBP hypointensity (P<0.001). In patients without peritumoral HBP hypointensity, the only significant difference between MVI-positive and MVI-negative HCCs was the presence of a radiological capsule (P=0.038). Satellite nodule was an independent risk factor for intrahepatic RFS (hazard ratio,3.324; 95% CI: 1.733–6.378; P<0.001). The high-risk HCC detection rate was significantly higher when using the two-step flowchart that incorporated peritumoral HBP hypointensity and satellite nodule than when using peritumoral HBP hypointensity alone (P<0.001). Conclusion In patients without peritumoral HBP hypointensity, a radiological capsule is useful for identifying MVI and satellite nodule is an independent risk factor for intrahepatic RFS.

Abstract: Understanding the morphology of the distal femur is essential for improving bone‐implant match in total knee arthroplasty (TKA) and understanding the mechanisms behind knee kinematics. However, little is known about the asymmetry of the posterior condyles. Thus, this study aimed to thoroughly investigate asymmetries in sizes and shapes between the medial and lateral posterior condyles before and after femoral resections during TKA in osteoarthritic (OA) knees.

Abstract: The training and running of an online Go system require the support of effective data management systems to deal with vast data, such as the initial Go game records, the feature data set obtained by representation learning, the experience data set of self-play, the randomly sampled Monte Carlo tree, and so on. Previous work has rarely mentioned this problem, but the ability and efficiency of data management systems determine the accuracy and speed of the Go system. To tackle this issue, we propose an online Go game system based on the chunk data storage method (CH-Go), which processes the format of 160k Go game data released by Kiseido Go Server (KGS) and designs a Go encoder with 11 planes, a parallel processor and generator for better memory performance. Specifically, we store the data in chunks, take the chunk size of 1024 as a batch, and save the features and labels of each chunk as binary files. Then a small set of data is randomly sampled each time for the neural network training, which is accessed by batch through yield method. The training part of the prototype includes three modules: supervised learning module, reinforcement learning module, and an online module. Firstly, we apply Zobrist-guided hash coding to speed up the Go board construction. Then we train a supervised learning policy network to initialize the self-play for generation of experience data with 160k Go game data released by KGS. Finally, we conduct reinforcement learning based on REINFORCE algorithm. Experiments show that the training accuracy of CH-Go in the sampled 150 games is 99.14%, and the accuracy in the test set is as high as 98.82 %. Under the condition of limited local computing power and time, we have achieved a better level of intelligence. Given the current situation that classical systems such as GOLAXY are not free and open, CH-Go has realized and maintained complete Internet openness.

Abstract: In order to study the bond-slip constitutive model between prestressed tendons and concrete, the pull-out tests of single-strand and multi-strands specimens are carried out. The effect of the number of prestressed tendons on the failure mode, slip characteristics and concrete strain of the pull-out specimens are analyzed, and the constitutive models of bond-slip between for single- strand and multi-strand tendons are also proposed. The results show that the bond mechanism between steel strand and concrete is basically similar to that of deformed steel bar, but the slip process of steel strand along the axis direction is accompanied by rotation phenomenon because it is twisted. Moreover, compared with the single-strand prestressed tendon, the average ultimate bond stress of each tendon of the three-strand prestressed tendons decreases by 13.2%. In addition, the calculated result of the pull-out limit load for the single-strand prestressed tendon is only 2% higher than the experimental value, while the corresponding value of three-strand prestressed tendon is only 3.74% lower than the experimental value. This means that the proposed bond-slip models for single- strand and multi-strand tendons have high reliability.

The position of entry point in total knee arthroplasty is associate with femoral bowing both in coronal and sagittal planes. Abstract: Objective To investigate the femoral entry point of the intramedullary (IM) guiding rod applied to total knee arthroplasty (TKA) in Chinese subjects and the relationship with femoral bowing in the coronal and sagittal planes through three-dimensional (3D) validation methods. Methods Computed tomography (CT) images of 80 femurs in Chinese subjects were imported into Mimics 19.0 to construct 3D models. All operations were conducted by Rhinoceros software 5.0. The position of the IM rod entry point was assessed by calculating the distance between the entry point and the apex of the intercondylar notch (AIN) in the coronal and sagittal planes. The coronal femoral bowing angle (cFBA) and sagittal femoral bowing angle (sFBA) were also measured. Results The average optimal entry point was 0.17 mm medial and 12.37 mm anterior to the AIN in males, while it was 0.02 mm lateral and 16.13 mm anterior to the AIN in females. There was a significant difference between males and females in the sagittal plane (t = -6.570, p = 0.000). The mean cFBA was 1.68 ± 2.29°, and the mean sFBA was 12.66 ± 1.98°. The sFBA was strongly correlated with the anterior distance of the proper entry point, and the cFBA was moderately correlated with the lateral distance of the proper entry point. Conclusions There was a strong correlation between the position of the entry point and the femoral bowing angle in both the coronal and sagittal planes. Thus, to achieve better alignment, the position of the entry point should be measured individually based on femoral bowing.

Abstract: Adding basalt fiber to concrete can improve the mechanical properties of concrete, and it is also one of the best ways to enhance the ultimate bearing capacity of concrete structure. In this paper, the construction performance and the compressive strength of basalt-fiber-reinforced concrete (BFRC) with five kinds of fiber lengths and eight kinds of fiber volume content subjected to an axial load are systematically investigated. The optimum fiber length and fiber volume content are obtained by comprehensively considering the construction performance and compressive strength. Moreover, the prediction model and finite element analysis method of the ultimate bearing capacity of basalt-fiber-reinforced concrete are developed. The results show that the optimum fiber length is about 12–24 mm and the fiber volume content is 0.15%. Adding an appropriate amount of basalt fiber can effectively improve the ultimate bearing capacity of concrete short columns, with maximum and average increases of 28% and 24%, respectively. In addition, the comparison with the experimental results shows that both the proposed prediction method and the finite element modeling method have good applicability, and they can be used to predict the ultimate bearing capacity of the BRFC short columns in practical engineering.

Abstract: Reasonable assessment of structural failure probability is essential to ensure the safety performance of corroded reinforced concrete (RC) structures. In this paper, a novel cross-sectional area loss model of corroded steel bars is proposed and the scale of fluctuation of some key parameters are estimated by the semivariogram function method. Then, a stochastic resistance deterioration model considering the effect of corrosion unbalanced and spatial variability and a time-dependent reliability assessment method of corroded concrete structures are proposed. In addition, a simple case analysis of corroded concrete structure is used to illustrate the application of the proposed method. The case analysis results show that the cumulative failure probability will be overestimated by using the popular pit area model, while it will be underestimated without considering the spatial variability of calculation parameters. Random field parameter analysis shows that appropriate choice of the element size is very important for the safety evaluation of RC structures. Additionally, compared with the marine atmospheric environment, the cumulative failure probability of case structure in the tidal and splash environment is increased by 20.15% and 70.40% respectively due to the gradual increase of corrosion current density. This indicates that the splash environment has the greatest impact on the structural failure probability among the three service environments.

Abstract: The comprehensive quality evaluation of distribution network equipment assets in the whole life cycle plays an important role in the development of distribution network enterprises. The quality evaluation of individual equipment is not representative, and it is not feasible to evaluate each piece of equipment. So, in this paper, the average quality level of similar distribution network equipment is evaluated from four aspects, procurement, installation, operation, and obsolescence, to make the evaluation results more representative and help distribution network enterprises to master the status of their equipment assets more efficiently. Under the evaluation index system, the analytic hierarchy process, the entropy weight method, and the least square method are used to get the comprehensive weight composed of the subjective weight and objective weight mixing. Then, by the fuzzy comprehensive evaluation method, the comprehensive weight is used to evaluate similar equipment in different regions and different equipment in the same region. Finally, the case analysis is carried out with the data of distribution cables and distribution transformers in H, Z, and J provinces to verify the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed index evaluation system and evaluation model.

Characterization of the Key Aroma Volatile Compounds in Nine Different Grape Varieties Wine by Headspace Gas Chromatography–Ion Mobility Spectrometry (HS-GC-IMS), Odor Activity Values (OAV) and Sensory Analysis. Abstract: During this study, the physicochemical properties, color, and volatile aroma compounds of the original wines produced from the grape varieties ‘Hassan’, ‘Zuoshaner’, ‘Beibinghong’, ‘Zuoyouhong’, ‘Beta’, ‘Shuanghong’, ‘Zijingganlu’, ‘Cabernet Sauvignon’, and ‘Syrah’ were determined and sensory evaluation was performed. Results indicated that ‘Hassan’ contained the most solids, ‘Zuoshaner’ produced the most total acid, residual sugar, total anthocyanin, and total phenol, and ‘Shuanghong’ produced the most tannin. Calculation of the chroma and hue of the wines according to the CIEL*a*b* parameters revealed that the ‘Cabernet Sauvignon’ wines were the brightest of the nine varieties and that the ‘Zuoshaner’ wines had the greatest red hue and yellow hue and the greatest saturation’. A total of 52 volatile compounds were identified and quantified in nine wine samples by HS-GC-IMS analysis, with the most significant number of species detected being 20 esters, followed by 16 alcohols, 8 aldehydes, four ketones, one terpene, and one furan, with the highest total volatile compound content being ‘Beta’. A total of 14 volatile components with OAV (odor activity value) >1 were calculated using the odor activity value (OAV) of the threshold of the aromatic compound, and the OPLS-DA analysis was performed by orthogonal partial least squares discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA) using the OAV values of the compounds with OAV values >1 as the Y variable. The VIP (Variable Importance in Projection) values of six compounds, ethyl isobutyrate, ethyl hexanoate-D, 2-methylpropanal, ethyl octanoate, ethyl butanoate-D, and Isoamyl acetate-D, were calculated to be higher than one between groups, indicating that these six compounds may influence aroma differences. It is essential to recognize that the results of this study have implications for understanding the quality differences between different varieties of wines and for developing wines that have the characteristics of those varieties.

Traffic4cast at NeurIPS 2021 - Temporal and Spatial Few-Shot Transfer Learning in Gridded Geo-Spatial Processes. Abstract: The IARAI Traffic4cast competitions at NeurIPS 2019 and 2020 showed that neural networks can successfully predict future traffic conditions 1 hour into the future on simply aggregated GPS probe data in time and space bins. We thus reinterpreted the challenge of forecasting traffic conditions as a movie completion task. U-Nets proved to be the winning architecture, demonstrating an ability to extract relevant features in this complex real-world geo-spatial process. Building on the previous competitions, Traffic4cast 2021 now focuses on the question of model robustness and generalizability across time and space. Moving from one city to an entirely different city, or moving from pre-COVID times to times after COVID hit the world thus introduces a clear domain shift. We thus, for the first time, release data featuring such domain shifts. The competition now covers ten cities over 2 years, providing data compiled from over 10^12 GPS probe data. Winning solutions captured traffic dynamics sufficiently well to even cope with these complex domain shifts. Surprisingly, this seemed to require only the previous 1h traffic dynamic history and static road graph as input.

Abstract: Histoplasmosis is an infection caused by the dimorphic fungus Histoplasma capsulatum. The lungs are the most common site of infection, especially in patients with immune deficiency. We report a case of 62-year-old male patient presented with cough for 3 months and had been taking immunosuppressive drugs for 10 years after heart transplantation. Chest CT scan showed multiple pulmonary nodules. Lung tissue biopsy specimen culture suggested fungal infection, and Histoplasma capsulatum was confirmed by next-generation sequencing (NGS) detection. The patient was diagnosed with pulmonary histoplasmosis. After administration of voriconazole for 46 days, the symptom of cough was markedly relieved and the lesions were partly absorbed. After 13 months of treatment, the lesions completely disappeared, and no significant side-effect of voriconazole was observed. To our knowledge, report of voriconazole as the treatment of histoplasmosis is rare, especially in non-endemic areas. Moreover, this case enriches our experience in the adjustment between immunosuppressive and antifungal agents in treating histoplasmosis.

Inhibition of Inflammatory Response and Promotion of Osteogenic Activity of Zinc-Doped Micro-Arc Titanium Oxide Coatings. Abstract: An early and sustained immune response can lead to chronic inflammation after the implant is placed in the body. The implantable materials with immunomodulatory effects can reduce the body’s immune response and promote the formation of ideal osseointegration between the implants and bone tissue. In this study, zinc-coated titanium micro-arc oxide coating was prepared on titanium surface by micro-arc oxidation. The physical properties, anti-inflammation, and osteogenesis of the material were evaluated. We have physically characterized the surface structure of the coatings by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS), and atomic force microscopy (AFM) and detected the release of Zn2+ from the coating surface by inductively coupled optical plasma emission spectrometry (ICP-OES). The BMSCs were inoculated on the surface of the coating, and the biocompatibility of the coating was evaluated by CCK-8 analysis and living and dead cell staining. The osteogenic effect of the layer on BMSCs was evaluated by alkaline phosphatase (ALP) assays, osteocalcin (OCN) immunofluorescence, and quantitative polymerase chain reaction (q-PCR). The survival status of RAW264.7 on the coating surface and the mRNA expression of the associated proinflammatory markers, tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), cluster of differentiation 86 (CD86), and inducible nitric oxide (INOS) were detected by CCK-8 analysis and q-PCR. In parallel, the cell counting kit-8 (CCK-8) analysis and q-PCR screened and evaluated the effective concentration of Zn2+ anti-inflammatory in vitro. The results show that the coating has good physical characterization, and Zn is uniformly bound to the surface of titanium and shows stable release and good biocompatibility to BMSCs, downregulating the expression of inflammation-related genes promoting the bone formation of BMSCs. We have successfully prepared zinc-coated micro-arc titanium oxide coating on the titanium surface, which has good osteogenesis and great anti-inflammatory potential and provides a new way for osseointegration in the implant.

Abstract: Objective To assess the difference between the posterior condylar angle (PCA) and the mechanical lateral distal femoral angle (mLDFA) in the osseous and cartilaginous contours in a non-arthritic Chinese population. Methods Computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) were obtained from 83 patients with knee injuries before arthroscopy, and femur and distal femoral cartilage three-dimensional (3D) models were constructed. The 3D cartilage model was arranged to share physical space with the 3D femoral model, and then PCA and mLDFA were measured on the osseous and cartilaginous contours, respectively. The differences between the measurements with and without cartilage were evaluated. Results The average PCA with cartilage was 2.88 ± 1.35° and without was 2.73 ± 1.34°. The difference was significant in all patients and females but not in males. The average mLDFA with cartilage was 84.73 ± 2.15° and without cartilage was 84.83 ± 2.26°, but the difference was statistically insignificant in all groups. Conclusion PCA on the osseous and cartilaginous contours significantly differed with and without cartilage in the female group, suggesting that cartilage thickness should be considered during preoperative femoral rotational resection planning.

A New Reference Axis for Tibial Component Rotation in Total Knee Arthroplasty: A Three-dimensional Computed Tomography Analysis. Abstract: The purpose of this study was to introduce a new reference axis for tibial rotation in total knee arthroplasty (TKA) and verify its reliability. A consecutive series of 80 knees that underwent TKA from 2018 to 2020 as well as 80 healthy knees were analyzed using a three-dimensional tibial model. A coordinate system was established based on the standard TKA tibial cut. The line connecting the lateral-tibial eminence and the medial 1/3rd of the tibial tubercle or the medial border of the tibial tubercle was identified as the lateral eminence line (LE line) and the medial lateral eminence line (MLE line), respectively. To evaluate the reliability of the new reference axis, Akagi's line, the medial third of the tibial tubercle (1/3 line) was compared with the LE and MLE lines by measuring the angle between the lines and the Z-axis. In the coronal view, the intersection angle (TPA), which is composed of the line connecting the center of the medial and lateral tibial plateau with the Z-axis, was measured. The mean angle between Akagi's line and the Z-axis in the healthy group and the osteoarthritis (OA) group was 87.57 ± 3.48° and 87.61 ± 3.47°, respectively. The mean angle between the LE line and Z-axis in the healthy and OA groups was 87.15 ± 4.13° and 86.78 ± 3.95°, respectively. A weak correlation was found between the TPA and Akagi's line and the 1/3 line. A moderate correlation was observed between the TPA and LE lines. There were no significant differences between the healthy and OA groups (P > 0.05) in any of the four reference axes. The LE line showed excellent intra- and inter-observer reliability and reproducibility. The novel and easily drawn LE line is a preferable option for tibial component rotational alignment in TKA.

Abstract: High performance concrete (HPC) is a kind of concrete with mineral admixtures, which has better resistance ability to chloride ions diffusion than ordinary concrete. In the present study, the authors carried out a chloride ion diffusion experiment for the HPC with fly ash and silica fume. The influence of the water–binder ratio (W/B), binary (Portland cement–Fly ash (PC-FS) and Portland cement–Silica fume (PC-SF) and ternary (Portland cement–Fly ash–Silica fume (PC-FA-SF)) combinations on the concrete compressive strength and chloride ion diffusion was investigated. It was found that the compressive strength of normal concrete and HPC increase with the decrease in the W/B, the ratio of W/B deceasing value to strength increasing value for normal concrete is 0.74, and for the HPC is 0.20, so the influence of the W/B on the concrete strength for normal concrete was obviously more than the HPC. The influence of the contents of the SF or FA on developing the concrete strength was limited. The concrete compressive strength of ternary combination specimens decreases with the increase in FA or SF when the content of the other mineral admixture SF or FA remained unchanged. The ternary combination was more efficient in prohibiting chlorides ingress insider the specimens than the binary combination. The mesoscopic simulation and the tested value of the chloride ion under the same depth was close, the average ratio of simulation value to tested value was 0.91. The aggregate shape and distribution also had a negligible influence on chloride diffusivity in the HPC, but the chloride ion concentration increased with the increase in aggregate size.

Abstract: Reasonable assessment of long-term prestress loss and crack resistance is essential to ensure the service performance of prestressed concrete (PC) bridges. In this paper, a novel prediction model of long-term prestress loss considering the coupling effect of shrinkage and creep of concrete, prestressing steel relaxation, and presence of nonprestressing steel as well as the corrosion of prestressing and nonprestressing steel is proposed. Then, the probability analysis approach of long-term prestress loss considering the uncertainties of calculation parameters and models is introduced. Moreover, the assessment approach of crack resistance of local and overall structure is also developed, taking into account the effect of corrosion and time-dependent long-term prestress loss. The previously proposed approaches are applied to a three-span PC box-girder bridge. It is found that the prediction results of long-term prestress loss have high uncertainty, and the upper bound of long-term prestress loss at the confidence level of 95% is approximately 50% higher than the result obtained by deterministic analysis. The effect of corrosion on the long-term prestress loss is basically negligible, and the crack resistance of bottom slab and web is more sensitive to the coupled effect of corrosion and long-term prestress loss than that of top slab. Additionally, setting vertical prestressing tendons is conducive to improving the crack resistance level of web and whole section.

Abstract: This paper mainly studies the problem of dynamic coupling under multiple optimization objectives and multiple constraints. Virtual coupling (VC), as a new train operation mode, effectively improves the operating efficiency of the line, but reduces the safety margin between trains, and requires higher control accuracy. As an important scenario of virtual coupling, dynamic formation has not formed a set of applicable train control strategies. Aiming at the dynamic train formation scenario of virtual coupling, propose a control architecture based on distributed model predictive control (DMPC). Numerical simulation using Matlab verifies the effectiveness of the algorithm in this paper. The simulation results show that the train is under the condition of satisfying the operating constraints. Compared with PID control, the method in this paper is more effective and more accurate.

Abstract: To achieve an excellent focus quality, the parameters of optical elements (OEs) are, in most of the synchrotron beamlines, manually adjusted. This procedure is not only time-consuming and experience-dependent but also extremely complex when various experimental requirements are involved. Responding to this challenge, we propose a new beamline alignment tool based on neural network-assisted design. This method can predict the parameters of OEs, according to experimental requirements. Specifically, the artificial neural network (ANN) training set is generated, based on SHADOW3 and Synchrotron Radiation Workshop (SRW) in OASYS. Then, the magnification factor (M) of the focusing lens and the position (P) of the secondary source is predicted, using the aforesaid tool. Finally, the parameters are verified by substituting back to the OASYS. The results show that learned NNs can predict the main parameters of the OEs with high accuracy (above 97%). Then bring the parameters above back to the OASYS software to obtain the re-tracing results. Furthermore, the final focused quality at the sample point satisfies the experimental design indicators. Experimental design indicators are flux, full width at half-maximum (FWHM) at the sampling point and transmission efficiency. Compared to other methods, this is a successful exploration of the ANN in the field of synchrotron beamline alignment, and it is an important guide for the design of beamlines alignment.

Abstract: Extreme multi-label text classification (XMTC) is the task of tagging each document with the relevant labels from a very large space of predefined categories. Recently, large pre-trained Transformer models have made significant performance improvements in XMTC, which typically use the embedding of the special CLS token to represent the entire document semantics as a global feature vector, and match it against candidate labels. However, we argue that such a global feature vector may not be sufficient to represent different granularity levels of semantics in the document, and that complementing it with the local word-level features could bring additional gains. Based on this insight, we propose an approach that combines both the local and global features produced by Transformer models to improve the prediction power of the classifier. Our experiments show that the proposed model either outperforms or is comparable to the state-of-the-art methods on benchmark datasets.

Quantitative Method of Classification and Discrimination of a Porous Carbonate Reservoir Integrating K‐means Clustering and Bayesian Theory. Abstract: Reservoir classification is a key link in reservoir evaluation. However, traditional manual means are inefficient, subjective, and classification standards are not uniform. Therefore, taking the Mishrif Formation of the Western Iraq as an example, a new reservoir classification and discrimination method is established by using the K‐means clustering method and the Bayesian discrimination method. These methods are applied to non‐cored wells to calculate the discrimination accuracy of the reservoir type, and thus the main reasons for low accuracy of reservoir discrimination are clarified. The results show that the discrimination accuracy of reservoir type based on K‐means clustering and Bayesian stepwise discrimination is strongly related to the accuracy of the core data. The discrimination accuracy rate of Type I, Type II, and Type V reservoirs is found to be significantly higher than that of Type III and Type IV reservoirs using the method of combining K‐means clustering and Bayesian theory based on logging data. Although the recognition accuracy of the new methodology for the Type IV reservoir is low, with average accuracy the new method has reached more than 82% in the entire study area, which lays a good foundation for rapid and accurate discrimination of reservoir types and the fine evaluation of a reservoir.
- Zhiqing Sun, Yiming Yang. 2022. S PARSE A TTENTION WITH L EARNING - TO -H ASH. Abstract: Transformer has become ubiquitous in sequence modeling tasks. As a key component of Transformer, self-attention does not scale to long sequences due to its quadratic time and space complexity with respect to the sequence length. To tackle this problem, recent work developed dynamic attention sparsification techniques based on Approximate Nearest Neighbor (ANN) methods, where similar queries and keys are allocated to the same hash bucket with high probability. However, the effectiveness of those ANN methods relies on the assumption that queries and keys should lie in the same space, which is not well justified. Besides, some of the ANN methods such as Locality-Sensitive Hashing (LSH) are randomized and cannot fully utilize the available real data distributions. To overcome these issues, this paper proposes a new strategy for sparse attention, namely LHA (Learningto-Hash Attention), which directly learns separate parameterized hash functions for queries and keys, respectively. Another advantage of LHA is that it does not impose extra constraints for queries and keys, which makes it applicable to the wide range of pre-trained Transformer models. Our experiments on evaluation of the WikiText-103 dataset for language modeling, the GLUE benchmark for natural language understanding, and the Lang-Range-Arena benchmark for multiple tasks (text/image classification, retrieval, etc.) show the superior performance of LHA over other strong Transformer variants.

Abstract: Intense spatiotemporal coupling states frequently appear in robotic tasks, and this coupling enriches the information encapsulated in each state. Taking advantage of historical observations can provide more information about the robot, especially for partially observable Markov decision processes. How to deal with this coupling remains a challenging issue in robotic reinforcement learning (RL), and we allege that the imbalanced processing capability of spatiotemporal details is one of the bottlenecks of the vanilla transformer model in learning robotic policies. To address this problem, we novelly propose an efficient spatiotemporal transformer structure. To our knowledge, this work is the first to improve the transformer with spatiotemporal information in RL. In each attention block, we sequentially execute attention computation twice: the first to process the temporal sequence of the input and the latter to manage the spatial state. This input reconstruction enables sufficient information extraction to promote data efficiency. We also add correlation encoding into the query and key computation of multi-head attention, providing the operability of associating states between and within time steps. We evaluate the proposed approach on several robot tasks, and it outperforms state-of-the-art transformer-based online RL.

Abstract: To study the effect of the local corrosion of prestressed steel strands on the shear failure mode and shear bearing capacity of concrete beams, unilateral steel strands in four post-tensioning prestressed concrete (PC) beams are corroded, and the shear test of four PC beams are performed. Moreover, a simplified calculation method for the shear bearing capacity of concrete beams with diagonal steel bars is proposed considering the effect of cross-sectional reduction of steel bars, the degradation of mechanical properties, and the cross-sectional damage of concrete. Results shows that the crack propagation mode and failure mode are unrelated to the corrosion of prestressed steel bars when the shear span ratio of beam is the same. The shear capacity of the beam decreases with the increase of corrosion rate, but the decreasing rate is lower than the increasing rate of the corrosion rate. The growth rate of stirrup stress is much greater than that of load after concrete tension and compression loss cracking, and the yield of stirrup can be used as a sign of the ultimate bearing capacity of the beam. In addition, by comparing the experimental and numerical simulation results, the proposed simplified calculation method for the shear bearing capacity of concrete beams is of high accuracy.

Abstract: This article presents a novel structure of spiking neural networks (SNNs) to simulate the joint function of multiple brain regions in handling precision physical interactions. This task desires efficient movement planning while considering contact prediction and fast radial compensation. Contact prediction demands the cognitive memory of the interaction model, and we novelly propose a double recurrent network to imitate the hippocampus, addressing the spatiotemporal property of the distribution. Radial contact response needs rich spatial information, and we use a cerebellum-inspired module to achieve temporally dynamic prediction. We also use a block-based feedforward network to plan movements, behaving like the prefrontal cortex. These modules are integrated to realize the joint cognitive function of multiple brain regions in prediction, controlling, and planning. We present an appropriate controller and planner to generate teaching signals and provide a feasible network initialization for reinforcement learning, which modifies synapses in accordance with reality. The experimental results demonstrate the validity of the proposed method.

Abstract: Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) have received increasing attention in recent machine learning. How to effectively leverage the rich structural information in complex graphs, such as knowledge graphs with heterogeneous types of entities and relations, is a primary open challenge in the field. Most GCN methods are either restricted to graphs with a homogeneous type of edges (e.g., citation links only), or focusing on representation learning for nodes only instead of jointly optimizing the embeddings of both nodes and edges for target-driven objectives. This paper addresses these limitations by proposing a novel framework, namely the GEneralized Multi-relational Graph Convolutional Networks (GEM-GCN), which combines the power of GCNs in graph-based belief propagation and the strengths of advanced knowledge-base embedding methods, and goes beyond. Our theoretical analysis shows that GEM-GCN offers an elegant unification of several well-known GCN methods as specific cases, with a new perspective of graph convolution. Experimental results on benchmark datasets show the advantageous performance of GEM-GCN over strong baseline methods in the tasks of knowledge graph alignment and entity classification.

Abstract: Germline selection of mtDNA is vital in maternal inheritance of mtDNA, as it can eliminate severe mtDNA mutations. However, current evidence concerning germline selection at meiosis level comes from incomplete mtDNA sequencing in human first polar body (PB1), which lacks persuasion. Here, we found various variants, including pathogenic mutation sites, present on whole genome of mtDNA in human PB1 compared with its oocyte. And that PB1 mitochondria with mtDNA variants were defective. Afterwards, to further explore how mitochondria enter PB, the defective mitochondria transfer in mouse germline, including cumulus-oocyte-complexes at germinal vesicle and matured oocytes stage. It confirmed that in the first and second meiosis, active purification selected defective mitochondria into PB1 and PB2. Thus, twice meiosis is the last defense system for purifying selection of mtDNA mutations during oogenesis, which also demonstrated that PB1 and PB2 would be final destination of deleterious mtDNA mutations in germline selection.

Abstract: Reasoning about events and tracking their influences is fundamental to understanding processes. In this paper, we present EIGEN - a method to leverage pre-trained language models to generate event influences conditioned on a context, nature of their influence, and the distance in a reasoning chain. We also derive a new dataset for research and evaluation of methods for event influence generation. EIGEN outperforms strong baselines both in terms of automated evaluation metrics (by 10 ROUGE points) and human judgments on closeness to reference and relevance of generations. Furthermore, we show that the event influences generated by EIGEN improve the performance on a "what-if" Question Answering (WIQA) benchmark (over 3% F1), especially for questions that require background knowledge and multi-hop reasoning.

Abstract: DETR is a recently proposed Transformer-based method which views object detection as a set prediction problem and achieves state-of-the-art performance but demands extra-long training time to converge. In this paper, we investigate the causes of the optimization difficulty in the training of DETR. Our examinations reveal several factors contributing to the slow convergence of DETR, primarily the issues with the Hungarian loss and the Transformer cross-attention mechanism. To overcome these issues we propose two solutions, namely, TSP-FCOS (Transformer-based Set Prediction with FCOS) and TSP-RCNN (Transformer-based Set Prediction with RCNN). Experimental results show that the proposed methods not only converge much faster than the original DETR, but also significantly outperform DETR and other baselines in terms of detection accuracy.

Abstract: With a large amount of parallel data, neural machine translation systems are able to deliver human-level performance for sentence-level translation. However, it is costly to label a large amount of parallel data by humans. In contrast, there is a large-scale of parallel corpus created by humans on the Internet. The major difficulty to utilize them is how to filter them out from the noise website environments. Current parallel data mining methods all require labeled parallel data as the training source. In this paper, we present a pipeline to mine the parallel corpus from the Internet in an unsupervised manner. On the widely used WMT'14 English-French and WMT'16 English-German benchmarks, the machine translator trained with the data extracted by our pipeline achieves very close performance to the supervised results. On the WMT'16 English-Romanian and Romanian-English benchmarks, our system produces new state-of-the-art results, 39.81 and 38.95 BLEU scores, even compared with supervised approaches.

Abstract: Natural Language Processing (NLP) has recently achieved great success by using huge pre-trained models with hundreds of millions of parameters. However, these models suffer from heavy model sizes and high latency such that they cannot be deployed to resource-limited mobile devices. In this paper, we propose MobileBERT for compressing and accelerating the popular BERT model. Like the original BERT, MobileBERT is task-agnostic, that is, it can be generically applied to various downstream NLP tasks via simple fine-tuning. Basically, MobileBERT is a thin version of BERT_LARGE, while equipped with bottleneck structures and a carefully designed balance between self-attentions and feed-forward networks. To train MobileBERT, we first train a specially designed teacher model, an inverted-bottleneck incorporated BERT_LARGE model. Then, we conduct knowledge transfer from this teacher to MobileBERT. Empirical studies show that MobileBERT is 4.3x smaller and 5.5x faster than BERT_BASE while achieving competitive results on well-known benchmarks. On the natural language inference tasks of GLUE, MobileBERT achieves a GLUE score of 77.7 (0.6 lower than BERT_BASE), and 62 ms latency on a Pixel 4 phone. On the SQuAD v1.1/v2.0 question answering task, MobileBERT achieves a dev F1 score of 90.0/79.2 (1.5/2.1 higher than BERT_BASE).

This paper investigates the operation cycle of the rack-moving machine for storage and retrieval from the perspective of the lane depth, especially exploring the particularity of the RMMR system in multi-deep lanes, and proposes expected travel time models of the rack-moving machine for single- and multi-deep layouts of the RMMR system. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed models, an experimental simulation was conducted with a 1–4-deep layout under six scenarios of different numbers of aisles and layers, and results were compared with results obtained using proposed models. The paper presents useful guidelines for the configuration of the RMMR system layout including the determination of the optimal lane depth.

Abstract: Knowledge graphs (KGs) contain rich information about world knowledge, entities, and relations. Thus, they can be great supplements to existing pre-trained language models. However, it remains a challenge to efficiently integrate information from KG into language modeling. And the understanding of a knowledge graph requires related context. We propose a novel joint pre-training framework, JAKET, to model both the knowledge graph and language. The knowledge module and language module provide essential information to mutually assist each other: the knowledge module produces embeddings for entities in text while the language module generates context-aware initial embeddings for entities and relations in the graph. Our design enables the pre-trained model to easily adapt to unseen knowledge graphs in new domains. Experiment results on several knowledge-aware NLP tasks show that our proposed framework achieves superior performance by effectively leveraging knowledge in language understanding.

Abstract: Autoregressive (AR) models have been the dominating approach to conditional sequence generation, but are suffering from the issue of high inference latency. Non-autoregressive (NAR) models have been recently proposed to reduce the latency by generating all output tokens in parallel but could only achieve inferior accuracy compared to their autoregressive counterparts, primarily due to a difficulty in dealing with the multi-modality in sequence generation. This paper proposes a new approach that jointly optimizes both AR and NAR models in a unified Expectation-Maximization (EM) framework. In the E-step, an AR model learns to approximate the regularized posterior of the NAR model. In the M-step, the NAR model is updated on the new posterior and selects the training examples for the next AR model. This iterative process can effectively guide the system to remove the multi-modality in the output sequences. To our knowledge, this is the first EM approach to NAR sequence generation. We evaluate our method on the task of machine translation. Experimental results on benchmark data sets show that the proposed approach achieves competitive, if not better, performance with existing NAR models and significantly reduces the inference latency.

Abstract: With the success of language pretraining, it is highly desirable to develop more efficient architectures of good scalability that can exploit the abundant unlabeled data at a lower cost. To improve the efficiency, we examine the much-overlooked redundancy in maintaining a full-length token-level presentation, especially for tasks that only require a single-vector presentation of the sequence. With this intuition, we propose Funnel-Transformer which gradually compresses the sequence of hidden states to a shorter one and hence reduces the computation cost. More importantly, by re-investing the saved FLOPs from length reduction in constructing a deeper or wider model, we further improve the model capacity. In addition, to perform token-level predictions as required by common pretraining objectives, Funnel-Transformer is able to recover a deep representation for each token from the reduced hidden sequence via a decoder. Empirically, with comparable or fewer FLOPs, Funnel-Transformer outperforms the standard Transformer on a wide variety of sequence-level prediction tasks, including text classification, language understanding, and reading comprehension.

Abstract: Change-point detection (CPD) aims at detecting the abrupt property changes lying behind time series data. The property changes in a multivariate time series often result from highly entangled reasons, ranging from independent changes of variables to correlation changes between variables. Learning to uncover the reasons behind the changes in an unsupervised setting is a new and challenging task. Previous CPD methods usually detect change-points by a divergence estimation of statistical features, without delving into the reasons behind the detected changes. In this paper, we propose a correlation-aware dynamics model which separately predicts the correlation change and independent change by incorporating graph neural networks into the encoder-decoder framework. Through experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets, we demonstrate the enhanced performance of our model on the CPD tasks as well as its ability to interpret the nature and degree of the predicted changes.

Abstract: We introduce a new task, Video-and-Language Inference, for joint multimodal understanding of video and text. Given a video clip with aligned subtitles as premise, paired with a natural language hypothesis based on the video content, a model needs to infer whether the hypothesis is entailed or contradicted by the given video clip. A new large-scale dataset, named Violin (VIdeO-and-Language INference), is introduced for this task, which consists of 95,322 video-hypothesis pairs from 15,887 video clips, spanning over 582 hours of video. These video clips contain rich content with diverse temporal dynamics, event shifts, and people interactions, collected from two sources: (i) popular TV shows, and (ii) movie clips from YouTube channels. In order to address our new multimodal inference task, a model is required to possess sophisticated reasoning skills, from surface-level grounding (e.g., identifying objects and characters in the video) to in-depth commonsense reasoning (e.g., inferring causal relations of events in the video). We present a detailed analysis of the dataset and an extensive evaluation over many strong baselines, providing valuable insights on the challenges of this new task.

Abstract: Relations among words and entities are important for semantic understanding of text, but previous work has largely not considered relations between relations, or meta-relations. In this paper, we specifically examine relation entailment, where the existence of one relation can entail the existence of another relation. Relation entailment allows us to construct relation hierarchies, enabling applications in representation learning, question answering, relation extraction, and summarization. To this end, we formally define the new task of predicting relation entailment and construct a dataset by expanding the existing Wikidata relation hierarchy without expensive human intervention. We propose several methods that incorporate both structured and textual information to represent relations for this task. Experiments and analysis demonstrate that this task is challenging, and we provide insights into task characteristics that may form a basis for future work. The dataset and code have been released at https://github.com/jzbjyb/RelEnt.

Abstract: This paper introduces a new task of politeness transfer which involves converting non-polite sentences to polite sentences while preserving the meaning. We also provide a dataset of more than 1.39 instances automatically labeled for politeness to encourage benchmark evaluations on this new task. We design a tag and generate pipeline that identifies stylistic attributes and subsequently generates a sentence in the target style while preserving most of the source content. For politeness as well as five other transfer tasks, our model outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on automatic metrics for content preservation, with a comparable or better performance on style transfer accuracy. Additionally, our model surpasses existing methods on human evaluations for grammaticality, meaning preservation and transfer accuracy across all the six style transfer tasks.

Abstract: Pre-trained contextual representations like BERT have achieved great success in natural language processing. However, the sentence embeddings from the pre-trained language models without fine-tuning have been found to poorly capture semantic meaning of sentences. In this paper, we argue that the semantic information in the BERT embeddings is not fully exploited. We first reveal the theoretical connection between the masked language model pre-training objective and the semantic similarity task theoretically, and then analyze the BERT sentence embeddings empirically. We find that BERT always induces a non-smooth anisotropic semantic space of sentences, which harms its performance of semantic similarity. To address this issue, we propose to transform the anisotropic sentence embedding distribution to a smooth and isotropic Gaussian distribution through normalizing flows that are learned with an unsupervised objective. Experimental results show that our proposed BERT-flow method obtains significant performance gains over the state-of-the-art sentence embeddings on a variety of semantic textual similarity tasks. The code is available at https://github.com/bohanli/BERT-flow.

Abstract: Residual flux density in the single-phase transformer core can dramatically increase inrush current when the transformer is energized. To reduce inrush current, it is necessary to study residual flux density measurement. This paper proposes a new residual flux density measurement method based on time constant. Firstly, the generation principle of residual flux density is analyzed under different magnetization states, and it is found that the positive relative differential permeability is smaller than the negative at different residual flux density. To obtain the relative differential permeability, when an appropriate DC excitation is applied, the measurement circuit is equivalent to a first-order RL circuit. Then, combining magnetic circuit and transient circuit analysis, the relationship between time constant and relative differential permeability is obtained. It is conclusion that the positive time constant is less than the negative. Residual flux density direction is determined by comparing the positive and negative time constant, and the magnitude of residual flux density is calculated by the relationship between residual flux density and the difference of the positive and negative time constant. Finally, the empirical formula between residual flux density and time constant difference of the square core is obtained in finite element method, and then verified on the experimental platform. Compared with other measurement methods, the relative error of proposed empirical formula is within 4.58 %, and it has higher accuracy in this paper. The proposed method in this paper can provide a reference for selecting the demagnetization voltage, which improves the effectiveness of demagnetization.
- Zhijun Wu, Yiming Yang, X. Lu. 2020. Design of Blockchain Ledger Compression Algorithm. Abstract: Blockchain has received widespread attention due to its decentralization, openness, autonomy, information tamper proof, and anonymity, and is currently on the rise. Some fatal weaknesses have been widely criticized in the process of evolution and development of blockchain technology. For example, the blockchain network has a large amount of data, large communication overhead, large storage overhead, and poor timeliness. The causes of these defects are complex, and the increase for data is the most important of many. In order to solve above problems, we research on the self-designed alliance chain that supports deletable ledger function, which can implement the function of searching and deleting ledger transactions. After the deletion request and execution are verified and agreed by the consensus nodes, the blockchain ledger is compressible or deletable. At the same time, the integrity of the forward and backward verification of the corresponding high-level blocks can be guaranteed without affecting the storage and usage of other blocks.

Abstract: A large number of facts prove that Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) has certain security risks and is threatened by attacks. In particular, GNSS civilian signal receivers have some vulnerability in responding to spoofing attack and jamming attack, because the format and modulation of GNSS civilian signals are public. Based on the concerns of existing GNSS spoofing scenarios, this article reviews the research on GNSS anti-spoofing technologies from two aspects. In this article, the strategies of spoofing attacks discovered at this stage are classified in detail, the protection effect and scheme implementation complexity of various anti-spoofing techniques against spoofing attacks are analyzed from the perspective of signal-level and data-level. More specifically, we comprehensively analyze the ability for the combined anti-spoofing methods at the signal-level and the data-level to protect from combinations of different spoofing attack. Finally, the future development trend and potential research direction of GNSS anti-spoofing technology are summarized and predicted.

Abstract: We consider the large-scale query-document retrieval problem: given a query (e.g., a question), return the set of relevant documents (e.g., paragraphs containing the answer) from a large document corpus. This problem is often solved in two steps. The retrieval phase first reduces the solution space, returning a subset of candidate documents. The scoring phase then re-ranks the documents. Critically, the retrieval algorithm not only desires high recall but also requires to be highly efficient, returning candidates in time sublinear to the number of documents. Unlike the scoring phase witnessing significant advances recently due to the BERT-style pre-training tasks on cross-attention models, the retrieval phase remains less well studied. Most previous works rely on classic Information Retrieval (IR) methods such as BM-25 (token matching + TF-IDF weights). These models only accept sparse handcrafted features and can not be optimized for different downstream tasks of interest. In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive study on the embedding-based retrieval models. We show that the key ingredient of learning a strong embedding-based Transformer model is the set of pre-training tasks. With adequately designed paragraph-level pre-training tasks, the Transformer models can remarkably improve over the widely-used BM-25 as well as embedding models without Transformers. The paragraph-level pre-training tasks we studied are Inverse Cloze Task (ICT), Body First Selection (BFS), Wiki Link Prediction (WLP), and the combination of all three.

Abstract: We propose a method of curating high-quality comparable training data for low-resource languages with monolingual annotators. Our method involves using a carefully selected set of images as a pivot between the source and target languages by getting captions for such images in both languages independently. Human evaluations on the English-Hindi comparable corpora created with our method show that 81.1% of the pairs are acceptable translations, and only 2.47% of the pairs are not translations at all. We further establish the potential of the dataset collected through our approach by experimenting on two downstream tasks - machine translation and dictionary extraction.

Abstract: Given the complexity of combinations of tasks, languages, and domains in natural language processing (NLP) research, it is computationally prohibitive to exhaustively test newly proposed models on each possible experimental setting. In this work, we attempt to explore the possibility of gaining plausible judgments of how well an NLP model can perform under an experimental setting, without actually training or testing the model. To do so, we build regression models to predict the evaluation score of an NLP experiment given the experimental settings as input. Experimenting on~9 different NLP tasks, we find that our predictors can produce meaningful predictions over unseen languages and different modeling architectures, outperforming reasonable baselines as well as human experts. %we represent experimental settings using an array of features. Going further, we outline how our predictor can be used to find a small subset of representative experiments that should be run in order to obtain plausible predictions for all other experimental settings.

Abstract: ABSTRACT Polyphasic taxonomic studies have been extensively carried out in cyanobacteria, resulting in the description of numerous cyanobacterial genera and species. The present study described a new cyanobacterial genus Compactonostoc gen. nov. based on a combination of morphological, genetic, and ecological evidence. The new genus was collected from a wet rocky wall in Shennongjia Forestry District, China. Colonies of the Compactonostoc strain were usually uniseriate or only in short segments biseriate when young, and filaments became densely entangled to form a macroscopic colony when mature; however, the filaments did not form spherical colonies. The phylogenetic tree based on 16S rRNA gene sequences showed that Compactonostoc formed a unique cluster, separating from the ‘Nostoc sensu stricto’ clade and from the clades of the morphologically similar genera Komarekiella, Desmonostoc and Mojavia. The 16S–23S rRNA internal transcribed spacer (ITS) secondary structure of the Compactonostoc strain showed a unique pattern of D1–D1′, Box-B and V3 helix, which distinguished it from other heterocystous genera. Compactonostoc shennongjiaensis sp. nov. was designated as the type species of the genus.

Abstract: While neural sequence generation models achieve initial success for many NLP applications, the canonical decoding procedure with left-to-right generation order (i.e., autoregressive) in one-pass can not reflect the true nature of human revising a sentence to obtain a refined result. In this work, we propose XL-Editor, a novel training framework that enables state-of-the-art generalized autoregressive pretraining methods, XLNet specifically, to revise a given sentence by the variable-length insertion probability. Concretely, XL-Editor can (1) estimate the probability of inserting a variable-length sequence into a specific position of a given sentence; (2) execute post-editing operations such as insertion, deletion, and replacement based on the estimated variable-length insertion probability; (3) complement existing sequence-to-sequence models to refine the generated sequences. Empirically, we first demonstrate better post-editing capabilities of XL-Editor over XLNet on the text insertion and deletion tasks, which validates the effectiveness of our proposed framework. Furthermore, we extend XL-Editor to the unpaired text style transfer task, where transferring the target style onto a given sentence can be naturally viewed as post-editing the sentence into the target style. XL-Editor achieves significant improvement in style transfer accuracy and also maintains coherent semantic of the original sentence, showing the broad applicability of our method.

Abstract: Knowledge Graph Completion (KGC) aims at automatically predicting missing links for large-scale knowledge graphs. A vast number of state-of-the-art KGC techniques have got published at top conferences in several research fields, including data mining, machine learning, and natural language processing. However, we notice that several recent papers report very high performance, which largely outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods. In this paper, we find that this can be attributed to the inappropriate evaluation protocol used by them and propose a simple evaluation protocol to address this problem. The proposed protocol is robust to handle bias in the model, which can substantially affect the final results. We conduct extensive experiments and report performance of several existing methods using our protocol. The reproducible code has been made publicly available.

Abstract: Three 36-year-old beams are taken as research objects to estimate the fluctuation scale θ of structural dimensions and material property parameters of reinforced concrete structure in service. First, the protective layer thickness Cd and the concrete compressive strength fc of service bridge component are measured, and the ordinary kriging method is used to interpolate the measured data and gather effective data. Second, the θ values of Cd and fc are estimated by two methods, namely autocorrelation function (ACF) and semivariogram function (SVF). Thereafter, the spatial distribution of R of each corroded steel bar is studied on the basis of measured values of the pitting factor R at different positions of 246 corroded steel bars. On the basis of one-dimensional random field theory, each beam is discretized into several small elements. According to the fluctuation scale obtained by different estimation methods, the random variables are transformed into spatial correlation variables, and the parameters of each discrete element are obtained. Then the bending capacity of each discrete beam element and the corresponding whole beam are obtained on the basis of the value of parameters of each discrete element. Finally, the two estimation methods are compared and analyzed by comparing the theoretical moment value and the bearing capacity test results of the corroded beams. Results show that the mean values of θ of fc and Cd obtained by the SVF method are 2.242 and 2.467, respectively, which are larger than that obtained by the ACF method. Moreover, the fluctuation intensity of concrete compressive strength is smaller with an increase of θ value, and no firm correlation is identified between the spatial distributions of each pit on the surface of a corroded steel reinforcement. The bending moments of three beams from the SVF method are in better agreement with the experimental values than those predicted from the ACF method. In addition, the average relative error of the theoretical bending moment value of all beams based on the SVF estimation is 6.52%, which is 33.19% lower than that obtained by ACF method. Therefore, the SVF method is more effective in describing the spatial properties of material and geometrical parameters compared with the ACF method.

Abstract: Extreme multi-label text classification (XMC) concerns tagging input text with the most relevant labels from an extremely large set. Recently, pre-trained language representation models such as BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) have been shown to achieve outstanding performance on many NLP tasks including sentence classification with small label sets (typically fewer than thousands). However, there are several challenges in extending BERT to the XMC problem, such as (i) the difficulty of capturing dependencies or correlations among labels, whose features may come from heterogeneous sources, and (ii) the tractability to scale to the extreme label setting because of the Softmax bottleneck scaling linearly with the output space. To overcome these challenges, we propose X-BERT, the first scalable solution to finetune BERT models on the XMC problem. Specifically, X-BERT leverages both the label and input text to build label representations, which induces semantic label clusters to better model label dependencies. At the heart of X-BERT is a procedure to finetune BERT models to capture the contextual relations between input text and the induced label clusters. Finally, an ensemble of the different BERT models trained on heterogeneous label clusters leads to our best final model, which leads to a state-of-the-art XMC method. In particular, on a Wiki dataset with around 0.5 million labels, the precision@1 of X-BERT is 67:87%, a substantial improvement over the neural baseline fastText and a state-of-the-art XMC approach Parabel, which achieves 32:58% and 60:91% precision@1, respectively.

Abstract: When trained effectively, the Variational Autoencoder (VAE) is both a powerful language model and an effective representation learning framework. In practice, however, VAEs are trained with the evidence lower bound (ELBO) as a surrogate objective to the intractable marginal data likelihood. This approach to training yields unstable results, frequently leading to a disastrous local optimum known as posterior collapse. In this paper, we investigate a simple fix for posterior collapse which yields surprisingly effective results. The combination of two known heuristics, previously considered only in isolation, substantially improves held-out likelihood, reconstruction, and latent representation learning when compared with previous state-of-the-art methods. More interestingly, while our experiments demonstrate superiority on these principle evaluations, our method obtains a worse ELBO. We use these results to argue that the typical surrogate objective for VAEs may not be sufficient or necessarily appropriate for balancing the goals of representation learning and data distribution modeling.

Abstract: Learning multilingual representations of text has proven a successful method for many cross-lingual transfer learning tasks. There are two main paradigms for learning such representations: (1) alignment, which maps different independently trained monolingual representations into a shared space, and (2) joint training, which directly learns unified multilingual representations using monolingual and cross-lingual objectives jointly. In this paper, we first conduct direct comparisons of representations learned using both of these methods across diverse cross-lingual tasks. Our empirical results reveal a set of pros and cons for both methods, and show that the relative performance of alignment versus joint training is task-dependent. Stemming from this analysis, we propose a simple and novel framework that combines these two previously mutually-exclusive approaches. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed framework alleviates limitations of both approaches, and outperforms existing methods on the MUSE bilingual lexicon induction (BLI) benchmark. We further show that this framework can generalize to contextualized representations such as Multilingual BERT, and produces state-of-the-art results on the CoNLL cross-lingual NER benchmark.

Recently, pretrained language representation models such as BERT achieve remarkable state-of-the-art performance across a wide range of NLP tasks including sentence classification among small label sets (typically fewer than thousands). Indeed, there are several challenges in applying BERT to the XMC problem. The main challenges are: (i) the difficulty of capturing dependencies and correlations among labels, whose features may come from heterogeneous sources, and (ii) the tractability to scale to the extreme label setting as the model size can be very large and scale linearly with the size of the output space. To overcome these challenges, we propose X-BERT, the first feasible attempt to finetune BERT models for a scalable solution to the XMC problem.

This amounts to a 11.31% relative improvement over Parabel, which is indeed significant since the recent approach SLICE only has 5.53% relative improvement.

Constrained Optimization and Distributed Model Predictive Control-Based Merging Strategies for Adjacent Connected Autonomous Vehicle Platoons. Abstract: Vehicle platooning has been a major research topic in recent years because of its ability to reduce fuel consumption, enhance road traffic safety and utilize the road more efficiently. A practical and applicable platoon merging maneuver is the key to forming new platoons while ensuring safety and economy. This study proposes merging strategies that consider both safe space and acceleration limitations for two adjacent platoons comprising connected autonomous vehicles (CAVs). The distributed model predictive control (DMPC) algorithm is adopted to design a DMPC2 controller, which includes 1) a space-making DMPC controller that controls the vehicles in one platoon, i.e. the target platoon, to make space for the vehicles in a second platoon, i.e. the merge platoon, and 2) a DMPC platoon controller that controls the merging vehicles to fill in the space in the target platoon. The former considers the explicit acceleration constraint of the vehicle, making the generated trajectory more feasible, and the latter controls the merge platoon to perform an overall mergence, which reduces the complexity of the merge problem. The low computation load of DMPC makes online computing and real-time control possible in practical scenarios. A simulation study is conducted with different scenarios and parameters, and the results demonstrate that the proposed strategy is more feasible and efficient, and less time-consuming than the existing state-of-the-art methods and have the advantages of taking safety distance and control input constraints into account.

Abstract: This paper demonstrates that analyzing language patterns in light of their associated facial expressions elicits significant differences between deceptive and truthful communication. Facial Action Units (AU) were analyzed in video recordings (1.2M frames) of 151 dyadic conversations following an interrogation protocol, in which one of the participants is known to be either lying or telling the truth. Linguistic features were extracted from the transcripts using Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC) dictionary. Our framework extracted facial-feature contexts automatically corresponding to high and low intensities of AU occurrences. This helped us dive deeper into answers corresponding to the video segments where the witnesses kept their eyes wide open (high intensity of AU05-upper lid raise). We found that in these segments, deceivers used significantly fewer ‘Seeing’, ‘Perceptual’ and ‘Cognitive’ words and their answers were significantly shorter than truth-tellers.

Abstract: While widely studied in robotics for decades, mobile manipulation has recently seen a surge in interest for industrial applications due to increasing demands on flexibility and agility alongside productivity, particularly in small and medium enterprises. However, most mobile manipulation solutions frequently decouple the navigation from the manipulation problem effectively performing fixed-base manipulation using a repositionable manipulator. This is not only inefficient, but moreover limits the range of applications and disregards the inherent redundancy of a mobile manipulation system. In this work, we introduce a high-performance omnidirectional mobile manipulation platform with integrated whole-body control, real-time collision-free whole-body motion planning, and perception. We demonstrate its capability along with application scenarios on technical demonstrators involving moving manipulation targets as well as whole-body manipulation in simulation and hardware experiments. Finally, we deploy and evaluate our solution in field trials on an industrial oil and gas training facility on a sensor placement and manipulation task.

Abstract: The scarcity of labeled training data often prohibits the internationalization of NLP models to multiple languages. Recent developments in cross-lingual understanding (XLU) has made progress in this area, trying to bridge the language barrier using language universal representations. However, even if the language problem was resolved, models trained in one language would not transfer to another language perfectly due to the natural domain drift across languages and cultures. We consider the setting of semi-supervised cross-lingual understanding, where labeled data is available in a source language (English), but only unlabeled data is available in the target language. We combine state-of-the-art cross-lingual methods with recently proposed methods for weakly supervised learning such as unsupervised pre-training and unsupervised data augmentation to simultaneously close both the language gap and the domain gap in XLU. We show that addressing the domain gap is crucial. We improve over strong baselines and achieve a new state-of-the-art for cross-lingual document classification.

Abstract: Extreme multi-label classification (XMC) aims to assign to an instance the most relevant subset of labels from a colossal label set. Due to modern applications that lead to massive label sets, the scalability of XMC has attracted much recent attention from both academia and industry. In this paper, we establish a three-stage framework to solve XMC efficiently, which includes 1) indexing the labels, 2) matching the instance to the relevant indices, and 3) ranking the labels from the relevant indices. This framework unifies many existing XMC approaches. Based on this framework, we propose a modular deep learning approach SLINMER: Semantic Label Indexing, Neural Matching, and Efficient Ranking. The label indexing stage of SLINMER can adopt different semantic label representations leading to different configurations of SLINMER. Empirically, we demonstrate that several individual configurations of SLINMER achieve superior performance than the state-of-the-art XMC approaches on several benchmark datasets. Moreover, by ensembling those configurations, SLINMER can achieve even better results. In particular, on a Wiki dataset with around 0.5 millions of labels, the precision@1 is increased from 61% to 67%.

Abstract: ABSTRACT This research studies automatic price pattern search procedure for bitcoin cryptocurrency based on 1-min price data. To achieve this, search algorithm is proposed based on nonparametric regression method of smoothing splines.

Abstract: In this work, we propose a method for neural dialogue response generation that allows not only generating semantically reasonable responses according to the dialogue history, but also explicitly controlling the sentiment of the response via sentiment labels. Our proposed model is based on the paradigm of conditional adversarial learning; the training of a sentiment-controlled dialogue generator is assisted by an adversarial discriminator which assesses the fluency and feasibility of the response generating from the dialogue history and a given sentiment label. Because of the flexibility of our framework, the generator could be a standard sequence-to-sequence (SEQ2SEQ) model or a more complicated one such as a conditional variational autoencoder-based SEQ2SEQ model. Experimental results using automatic and human evaluation both demonstrate that our proposed framework is able to generate both semantically reasonable and sentiment-controlled dialogue responses.

Abstract: Transformers have a potential of learning longer-term dependency, but are limited by a fixed-length context in the setting of language modeling. We propose a novel neural architecture Transformer-XL that enables learning dependency beyond a fixed length without disrupting temporal coherence. It consists of a segment-level recurrence mechanism and a novel positional encoding scheme. Our method not only enables capturing longer-term dependency, but also resolves the context fragmentation problem. As a result, Transformer-XL learns dependency that is 80% longer than RNNs and 450% longer than vanilla Transformers, achieves better performance on both short and long sequences, and is up to 1,800+ times faster than vanilla Transformers during evaluation. Notably, we improve the state-of-the-art results of bpc/perplexity to 0.99 on enwiki8, 1.08 on text8, 18.3 on WikiText-103, 21.8 on One Billion Word, and 54.5 on Penn Treebank (without finetuning). When trained only on WikiText-103, Transformer-XL manages to generate reasonably coherent, novel text articles with thousands of tokens. Our code, pretrained models, and hyperparameters are available in both Tensorflow and PyTorch.

Abstract: Having standardized metadata is the first step toward deploying smart building applications over heterogeneous buildings. Such a conversion process is highly manual because of different conventions in existing building metadata and diverse building configurations. Many machine learning methods have been attempted to ease the process by reducing the amount of experts' training examples and reusing the knowledge in different data sets. However, many of the end-users, such as building managers and commissioning practitioners, are unfamiliar with machine learning and programming interfaces. We implement and demonstrate a web-based graphical user interface whose workflow is designed based on a common programming interface, Plaster, for building metadata normalization. We implement three algorithms, Zodiac, BuildingAdapter, and Scrabble, though any new algorithms can be added. Users are instructed for proper actions with information visualization at each step to easily complete the procedure. The service is freely available at https://plaster.ucsd.edu.

Abstract: Definition extraction has been a popular topic in NLP research for well more than a decade, but has been historically limited to well-defined, structured, and narrow conditions. In reality, natural language is messy, and messy data requires both complex solutions and data that reflects that reality. In this paper, we present a robust English corpus and annotation schema that allows us to explore the less straightforward examples of term-definition structures in free and semi-structured text.

Although the notion of universal kernels and characteristic kernels has been studied, kernel selection still greatly influences the empirical performance. While learning the kernel in a data driven way has been investigated, in this paper we explore learning the spectral distribution of kernel via implicit generative models parametrized by deep neural networks. We called our method Implicit Kernel Learning (IKL). The proposed framework is simple to train and inference is performed via sampling random Fourier features. We investigate two applications of the proposed IKL as examples, including generative adversarial networks with MMD (MMD GAN) and standard supervised learning. Empirically, MMD GAN with IKL outperforms vanilla predefined kernels on both image and text generation benchmarks; using IKL with Random Kitchen Sinks also leads to substantial improvement over existing state-of-the-art kernel learning algorithms on popular supervised learning benchmarks. Theory and conditions for using IKL in both applications are also studied as well as connections to previous state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: Massively parallel single-cell and single-nucleus RNA-seq (sc/snRNA-seq) have opened the way to systematic tissue atlases in health and disease, but as the scale of data generation is growing, so does the need for computational pipelines for scaled analysis. Here, we developed Cumulus, a cloud-based framework for analyzing large scale sc/snRNA-seq datasets. Cumulus combines the power of cloud computing with improvements in algorithm implementations to achieve high scalability, low cost, user-friendliness, and integrated support for a comprehensive set of features. We benchmark Cumulus on the Human Cell Atlas Census of Immune Cells dataset of bone marrow cells and show that it substantially improves efficiency over conventional frameworks, while maintaining or improving the quality of results, enabling large-scale studies.

Abstract: With the capability of modeling bidirectional contexts, denoising autoencoding based pretraining like BERT achieves better performance than pretraining approaches based on autoregressive language modeling. However, relying on corrupting the input with masks, BERT neglects dependency between the masked positions and suffers from a pretrain-finetune discrepancy. In light of these pros and cons, we propose XLNet, a generalized autoregressive pretraining method that (1) enables learning bidirectional contexts by maximizing the expected likelihood over all permutations of the factorization order and (2) overcomes the limitations of BERT thanks to its autoregressive formulation. Furthermore, XLNet integrates ideas from Transformer-XL, the state-of-the-art autoregressive model, into pretraining. Empirically, under comparable experiment settings, XLNet outperforms BERT on 20 tasks, often by a large margin, including question answering, natural language inference, sentiment analysis, and document ranking.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for prediction tasks like node classification or edge prediction have received increasing attention in recent machine learning from graphically structured data. However, a large quantity of labeled graphs is difficult to obtain, which significantly limits the true success of GNNs. Although active learning has been widely studied for addressing label-sparse issues with other data types like text, images, etc., how to make it effective over graphs is an open question for research. In this paper, we present an investigation on active learning with GNNs for node classification tasks. Specifically, we propose a new method, which uses node feature propagation followed by K-Medoids clustering of the nodes for instance selection in active learning. With a theoretical bound analysis we justify the design choice of our approach. In our experiments on four benchmark datasets, the proposed method outperforms other representative baseline methods consistently and significantly.

Effect of Intratracheal Instillation of ZnO Nanoparticles on Acute Lung Inflammation Induced by Lipopolysaccharides in Mice.. Abstract: Although studies have shown toxic effects of zinc oxide (ZnO) particles following inhalation, additional effects on injured lungs, which are characterized by dysfunction of the alveolar-capillary barriers, remain uncharacterized. To explore these additional effects, nano-sized ZnO (nZnO) and bulk-sized ZnO (bZnO) were applied to lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-challenged mouse lungs, which were used as a disease model of acute lung inflammation. An elevated Zn2+ concentration was detected in lung tissue after LPS plus nZnO exposure. Exposure to nZnO in LPS-challenged mice resulted in higher total cell number, proportion of neutrophils, and total protein level in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid. Intratracheal instillation of nZnO intensively aggravated LPS-induced lung inflammation that was accompanied by enhanced expression of interleukin-1β, interleukin-6, monocyte chemotactic protein-1αand granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor. Catalase, glutathione, and total superoxide dismutase levels were significantly decreased, and the malondialdehyde level was obviously increased in the LPS plus nZnO group. 8-Hydroxyguanosine, a marker for DNA damage, was highly concentrated in the lungs from the LPS plus nZnO group. Furthermore, nZnO increased lung apoptosis in an acute lung inflammation model. Taken together, this evidence indicates that nZnO aggravates lung inflammation related to LPS. This enhancement effect may be mediated via oxidative stress, which can lead to DNA damage and apoptosis. This work is important because of the ever-increasing exposure of people to ZnO nanoparticles in industry. The identification of the toxic effects of nZnO and possible mechanisms revealed in this study provide valuable information for future studies.
- Zihang Dai, Guokun Lai, Yiming Yang, Shinjae Yoo. 2019. Re-examination of the Role of Latent Variables in Sequence Modeling. Abstract: With latent variables, stochastic recurrent models have achieved state-of-the-art performance in modeling sound-wave sequence. However, opposite results are also observed in other domains, where standard recurrent networks often outperform stochastic models. To better understand this discrepancy, we re-examine the roles of latent variables in stochastic recurrent models for speech density estimation. Our analysis reveals that under the restriction of fully factorized output distribution in previous evaluations, the stochastic models were implicitly leveraging intra-step correlation but the standard recurrent baselines were prohibited to do so, resulting in an unfair comparison. To correct the unfairness, we remove such restriction in our re-examination, where all the models can explicitly leverage intra-step correlation with an auto-regressive structure. Over a diverse set of sequential data, including human speech, MIDI music, handwriting trajectory and frame-permuted speech, our results show that stochastic recurrent models fail to exhibit any practical advantage despite the claimed theoretical superiority. In contrast, standard recurrent models equipped with an auto-regressive output distribution consistently perform better, significantly advancing the state-of-the-art results on three speech datasets.
- Yiming Yang. 2018. Motion synthesis for high degree-of-freedom robots in complex and changing environments. Abstract: The use of robotics has recently seen significant growth in various domains such as unmanned ground/underwater/aerial vehicles, smart manufacturing, and humanoid robots. However, one of the most important and essential capabilities required for long term autonomy, which is the ability to operate robustly and safely in real-world environments, in contrast to industrial and laboratory setup is largely missing. Designing robots that can operate reliably and efficiently in cluttered and changing environments is non-trivial, especially for high degree-of-freedom (DoF) systems, i.e. robots with multiple actuators. On one hand, the dexterity offered by the kinematic redundancy allows the robot to perform dexterous manipulation tasks in complex environments, whereas on the other hand, such complex system also makes controlling and planning very challenging. To address such two interrelated problems, we exploit robot motion synthesis from three perspectives that feed into each other: endpose planning, motion planning and motion adaptation. We propose several novel ideas in each of the three phases, using which we can efficiently synthesise dexterous manipulation motion for fixed-base robotic arms, mobile manipulators, as well as humanoid robots in cluttered and potentially changing environments. Collision-free inverse kinematics (IK), or so-called end-pose planning, a key prerequisite for other modules such as motion planning, is an important and yet unsolved problem in robotics. Such information is often assumed given, or manually provided in practice, which significantly limiting high-level autonomy. In our research, by using novel data pre-processing and encoding techniques, we are able to efficiently search for collision-free end-poses in challenging scenarios in the presence of uneven terrains. After having found the end-poses, the motion planning module can proceed. Although motion planning has been claimed as well studied, we find that existing algorithms are still unreliable for robust and safe operations in real-world applications,
- Ruochen Xu, Yiming Yang, Naoki Otani, Yuexin Wu. 2018. Unsupervised Cross-lingual Transfer of Word Embedding Spaces. Abstract: Cross-lingual transfer of word embeddings aims to establish the semantic mappings among words in different languages by learning the transformation functions over the corresponding word embedding spaces. Successfully solving this problem would benefit many downstream tasks such as to translate text classification models from resource-rich languages (e.g. English) to low-resource languages. Supervised methods for this problem rely on the availability of cross-lingual supervision, either using parallel corpora or bilingual lexicons as the labeled data for training, which may not be available for many low resource languages. This paper proposes an unsupervised learning approach that does not require any cross-lingual labeled data. Given two monolingual word embedding spaces for any language pair, our algorithm optimizes the transformation functions in both directions simultaneously based on distributional matching as well as minimizing the back-translation losses. We use a neural network implementation to calculate the Sinkhorn distance, a well-defined distributional similarity measure, and optimize our objective through back-propagation. Our evaluation on benchmark datasets for bilingual lexicon induction and cross-lingual word similarity prediction shows stronger or competitive performance of the proposed method compared to other state-of-the-art supervised and unsupervised baseline methods over many language pairs.
- Guokun Lai, Bohan Li, Guoqing Zheng, Yiming Yang. 2018. Stochastic WaveNet: A Generative Latent Variable Model for Sequential Data. Abstract: How to model distribution of sequential data, including but not limited to speech and human motions, is an important ongoing research problem. It has been demonstrated that model capacity can be significantly enhanced by introducing stochastic latent variables in the hidden states of recurrent neural networks. Simultaneously, WaveNet, equipped with dilated convolutions, achieves astonishing empirical performance in natural speech generation task. In this paper, we combine the ideas from both stochastic latent variables and dilated convolutions, and propose a new architecture to model sequential data, termed as Stochastic WaveNet, where stochastic latent variables are injected into the WaveNet structure. We argue that Stochastic WaveNet enjoys powerful distribution modeling capacity and the advantage of parallel training from dilated convolutions. In order to efficiently infer the posterior distribution of the latent variables, a novel inference network structure is designed based on the characteristics of WaveNet architecture. State-of-the-art performances on benchmark datasets are obtained by Stochastic WaveNet on natural speech modeling and high quality human handwriting samples can be generated as well.
- Fangfang Cai, Yiming Yang, Qianzhi Wen, Renhui Li. 2018. Desmonostoc danxiaense sp. nov. (Nostocales, Cyanobacteria) from Danxia mountain in China based on polyphasic approach. Abstract: The recently established genus Desmonostoc was characterized by forming macroscopic colonies with diffluent mucilaginous envelopes embedding long vegetative filaments and possessing long chains of akinetes. The establishment of this new genus was further supported by the clustering of the 16S rRNA gene, which have a distinctive phylogenetic placement outside of Nostoc. In this study, a new cyanobacterial species was isolated from a wet rocky wall in Danxia mountain, Guangdong province, southern China, and the novel strains of this new species were evaluated by combining morphological characteristic and molecular data on the 16S rRNA gene and 16S-23S internally transcribed spacer (ITS). This new taxon was found to be closest to Desmonostoc species. The separation of the new species described here as Desmonostoc danxiaense, using morphological and molecular traits, was based on differences in phenotypic, 16S rRNA gene, ITS sequence and its secondary structure.
- José Cano, Yiming Yang, Bruno Bodin, V. Nagarajan, M. O’Boyle. 2018. Automatic Parameter Tuning of Motion Planning Algorithms. Abstract: Motion planning algorithms attempt to find a good compromise between planning time and quality of solution. Due to their heuristic nature, they are typically configured with several parameters. In this paper we demonstrate that, in many scenarios, the widely used default parameter values are not ideal. However, finding the best parameters to optimise some metric(s) is not trivial because the size of the parameter space can be large. We evaluate and compare the efficiency of four different methods (i.e. random sampling, AUC-Bandit, random forest, and bayesian optimisation) to tune the parameters of two motion planning algorithms, BKPIECE and RRT-connect. We present a table-top-reaching scenario where the seven degrees-of-freedom KUKA LWR robotic arm has to move from an initial to a goal pose in the presence of several objects in the environment. We show that the best methods for BKPIECE (AUC-Bandit) and RRT-Connect (random forest) improve the performance by 4.5x and 1.26x on average respectively. Then, we generate a set of random scenarios of increasing complexity, and we observe that optimal parameters found in simple environments perform well in more complex scenarios. Finally, we find that the time required to evaluate parameter configurations can be reduced by more than 2/3 with low error. Overall, our results demonstrate that for a variety of motion planning problems it is possible to find solutions that significantly improve the performance over default configurations while requiring very reasonable computation times.
- Lei Yan, Yiming Yang, Wenfu Xu, S. Vijayakumar. 2018. Dual-Arm Coordinated Motion Planning and Compliance Control for Capturing Moving Objects with Large Momentum. Abstract: Capturing a moving object with large momentum by a dual-arm robot is especially challenging because of the requirement of dual-arm coordinated motion planning for tracking the moving object, and the operational force control for contact and momentum transfer. In this paper, we present a dual-arm coordinated motion planning and compliance control method with a unique null-space projected relative Jacobian and relative operational force between the two arms. The proposed method is able to plan dual-arm capturing motion and control the capturing force without disturbing the tracking motion. We have also adopted a direct collocation trajectory optimization method to generate optimal trajectory to decrease the object's momentum with minimum effort. Simulation and experiment of dual-arm robots picking up a moving box on a mobile platform are carried out to verify the proposed method.
- Yiming Yang. 2018. Large-scale Machine Learning over Graphs. Abstract: Graphs provide powerful representations for statistical modeling of interrelated variables (observed or latent) in a broad range of machine learning applications. Examples include learning and inference based on the dependency structures among words, documents, topics, users, items, web sites, and more. How to best leverage such dependency structures from multiple graphs with massive and heterogeneous types of nodes and relations has posed grand challenges to machine learning theory and algorithms. This talk presents our recent work in this direction focusing on three significant tasks, including 1) a novel framework for fusing multiple heterogeneous graphs into a unified product graph to enable semi-supervised multi-relational learning, 2) the first algorithmic solution for imposing analogical structures in graph-based entity/relation embedding, and 3) a new formulation of neural architecture search as a graph topology optimization problem, with simple yet powerful algorithms that automatically discover high-performing convolutional neural architectures on image recognition benchmarks, and reduce the computational cost over state-of-the-art non-differentiable techniques by several orders of magnitude.

Abstract: We propose a novel neural architecture, Transformer-XL, for modeling longerterm dependency. To address the limitation of fixed-length contexts, we introduce a notion of recurrence by reusing the representations from the history. Empirically, we show state-of-the-art (SoTA) results on both word-level and character-level language modeling datasets, including WikiText-103, One Billion Word, Penn Treebank, and enwiki8. Notably, we improve the SoTA results from 1.06 to 0.99 in bpc on enwiki8, from 33.0 to 18.9 in perplexity on WikiText-103, and from 28.0 to 23.5 in perplexity on One Billion Word. Performance improves when the attention length increases during evaluation, and our best model attends to up to 1,600 words and 3,800 characters. To quantify the effective length of dependency, we devise a new metric and show that on WikiText-103 Transformer-XL manages to model dependency that is about 80% longer than recurrent networks and 450% longer than Transformer. Moreover, Transformer-XL is up to 1,800+ times faster than vanilla Transformer during evaluation.

Abstract: The use of machine learning for NLP generally requires resources for training. Tasks performed in a low-resource language usually rely on labeled data in another, typically resource-rich, language. However, there might not be enough labeled data even in a resource-rich language such as English. In such cases, one approach is to use a hand-crafted approach that utilizes only a small bilingual dictionary with minimal manual verification to create distantly supervised data. Another is to explore typical machine learning techniques, for example adversarial training of bilingual word representations. We find that in event-type detection task—the task to classify [parts of] documents into a fixed set of labels—they give about the same performance. We explore ways in which the two methods can be complementary and also see how to best utilize a limited budget for manual annotation to maximize performance gain.

Abstract: Training task-completion dialogue agents with reinforcement learning usually requires a large number of real user experiences. The Dyna-Q algorithm extends Q-learning by integrating a world model, and thus can effectively boost training efficiency using simulated experiences generated by the world model. The effectiveness of Dyna-Q, however, depends on the quality of the world model - or implicitly, the pre-specified ratio of real vs. simulated experiences used for Q-learning. To this end, we extend the recently proposed Deep Dyna-Q (DDQ) framework by integrating a switcher that automatically determines whether to use a real or simulated experience for Q-learning. Furthermore, we explore the use of active learning for improving sample efficiency, by encouraging the world model to generate simulated experiences in the stateaction space where the agent has not (fully) explored. Our results show that by combining switcher and active learning, the new framework named as Switch-based Active Deep Dyna-Q (Switch-DDQ), leads to significant improvement over DDQ and Q-learning baselines in both simulation and human evaluations.1

Abstract: Convolution Neural Network (CNN) has gained tremendous success in computer vision tasks with its outstanding ability to capture the local latent features. Recently, there has been an increasing interest in extending CNNs to the general spatial domain. Although various types of graph convolution and geometric convolution methods have been proposed, their connections to traditional 2D-convolution are not well-understood. In this paper, we show that depthwise separable convolution is a path to unify the two kinds of convolution methods in one mathematical view, based on which we derive a novel Depthwise Separable Graph Convolution that subsumes existing graph convolution methods as special cases of our formulation. Experiments show that the proposed approach consistently outperforms other graph convolution and geometric convolution baselines on benchmark datasets in multiple domains.

Abstract: Planning balanced whole-body reaching configurations is a fundamental problem in humanoid robotics on which manipulation and locomotion planners depend on. While finding valid whole-body configurations in free space and on flat terrains is relatively straightforward, the problem becomes extremely challenging when obstacle avoidance is taken into account, and when balancing on more complex terrains, such as inclined supports or steps. Previous work using Paired Forward-Inverse Dynamic Reachability Maps demonstrated fast end-pose planning on flat terrains at different heights by decomposing the kinematic structure and leveraging combinatorics. In this paper, we present an efficient whole-body end-pose planning framework capable of finding collision-free whole-body configurations in complex environments and on sloped support regions. The main contributions in this paper are twofold: (i) the integration of contact property information of support regions into both precomputation and online planning stages, including whole-body static equilibrium robustness, and (ii) the proposal of a more informed and meaningful sampling strategy for the lower-body. We focus on humanoid robots throughout the paper, but all the principles can be applied to legged platforms other than bipedal robots. We demonstrate our method on the NASA Valkyrie humanoid platform with 38 Degrees of Freedom (DoF) over inclined supports. Analysis of the results indicate both higher success rates – greater than 95 % and 80 % on obstacle-free and highly cluttered environments, respectively – and shorter computation times compared to previous methods.

Abstract: Predicting new and urgent trends in epidemiological data is an important problem for public health, and has attracted increasing attention in the data mining and machine learning communities. The temporal nature of epidemiology data and the need for real-time prediction by the system makes the problem residing in the category of time-series forecasting or prediction. While traditional autoregressive (AR) methods and Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) have been actively studied for solving this problem, deep learning techniques have not been explored in this domain. In this paper, we develop a deep learning framework, for the first time, to predict epidemiology profiles in the time-series perspective. We adopt Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) to capture the long-term correlation in the data and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to fuse information from data of different sources. A residual structure is also applied to prevent overfitting issues in the training process. We compared our model with the most widely used AR models on USA and Japan datasets. Our approach provides consistently better results than these baseline methods.

Abstract: In this paper we introduce the Common Human Emotional Expression Set Encoder (CHEESE) framework for objectively determining which, if any, subsets of the facial action units associated with smiling are well represented by a small finite set of clusters according to an information theoretic metric. Smile-related AUs (6,7,10,12,14) in over 1.3M frames of facial expressions from 151 pairs of individuals playing a communication game involving deception were analyzed with CHEESE. The combination of AU6 (cheek raiser) and AU12 (lip corner puller) are shown to cluster well into five different types of expression. Liars showed high intensity AU6 and AU12 more often compared to honest speakers. Additionally, interrogators were found to express a higher frequency of low intensity AU6 with high intensity AU12 (i.e. polite smiles) when they were being lied to, suggesting that deception analysis should be done in consideration of both the message sender's and the receiver's facial expressions.

Abstract: In this letter, we first theoretically prove the conditions and boundaries of resolution completeness for deterministic roadmap methods with a discretized workspace. A novel variant of such methods, the hierarchical dynamic roadmap (HDRM), is then proposed for solving complex planning problems. A unique hierarchical structure to efficiently encode the configuration-to-workspace occupation information is introduced and allows the robot to check the collision state of tens of millions of samples on-the-fly—the number of which was previously strictly limited by available memory. The hierarchical structure also significantly reduces the time for path searching, hence, the robot is able to find feasible motion plans in real-time in extremely constrained environments. A rigorous benchmarking shows that HDRM is robust and computationally fast compared with classical dynamic roadmap methods and other state-of-the-art planning algorithms. Experiments on the seven degree-of-freedom KUKA LWR robotic arm integrated with live perception further validate the effectiveness of HDRM in complex environments.

Abstract: This paper addresses the scalability challenge of architecture search by formulating the task in a differentiable manner. Unlike conventional approaches of applying evolution or reinforcement learning over a discrete and non-differentiable search space, our method is based on the continuous relaxation of the architecture representation, allowing efficient search of the architecture using gradient descent. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-10, ImageNet, Penn Treebank and WikiText-2 show that our algorithm excels in discovering high-performance convolutional architectures for image classification and recurrent architectures for language modeling, while being orders of magnitude faster than state-of-the-art non-differentiable techniques.

A new method for estimating the scale of fluctuation in reliability assessment of reinforced concrete structures considering spatial variability. Abstract: The scale of fluctuation (θ) of the material and geometrical parameters is the basis of studying the spatial variability of reinforced concrete structures. In this article, a new estimation method for the scale of fluctuation based on Bayesian information criterion is proposed. And based on the analysis of experimental data recorded on the three 36-year-old beams of the Jianggong Bridge and 246 corroded steel bars, the scale of fluctuation (θ) of concrete compressive strength (fc) and steel pitting factor (R) are estimated. The theoretical bending moment of three test beams are calculated considering the influence of the spatial distributions of fc, R, and other relative variables. The reasonableness and superiority of the Bayesian information criterion model than the auto-correlation function method and the semivariogram function model are verified by comparing the theoretical results with the measured bending moment of the three beams mentioned above.

Abstract: This paper presents a novel sampling-based motion planning method using bidirectional search with a time-configuration space representation that is able to efficiently generate collision-free trajectories in complex and non-static environments. Our approach exploits time indexing to separate a complex problem with mixed constraints into multiple subproblems with simpler constraints that can be solved efficiently. We further introduce a planning framework by incorporating the proposed planning method enabling efficient pick-and-place of large objects in various scenarios. Simulation as well as hardware experiments show that the method also scales from redundant robot arms to mobile manipulators and humanoids. In particular, we have demonstrated that the proposed method is able to plan collision-free motion for a humanoid robot to pick up a large object placed inside a moving storage box while walking.

Abstract: Extreme multi-label classification (XMC) aims at assigning to an instance the most relevant subset of labels from a colossal label set. There have been some success in formulating the multi-label problem as sequence-to-sequence (Seq2Seq) learning, where the positive class labels of each input instance are used as the corresponding output sequence. Seq2Seq methods, nonetheless, have not yet been scalable to the XMC setting due to the softmax bottleneck. In this paper, we propose a semantic coding framework, namely SeCSeq, for a Seq2Seq approach to the XMC problem. To circumvent the softmax bottleneck, SeCSeq compresses labels into sequences of semantic-aware compact codes, on which Seq2Seq models are trained. For inference, the generated semantic codes are then decompressed into sequences of positive labels using ensemble techniques. Preliminary experiments on XMC benchmark datasets show that SeCSeq is competitive with the state-of-the-art while requiring significantly fewer model parameters.

Abstract: : Leveraging intrinsic graph structures in data to improve bipartite edge prediction has become an increasingly important topic in the recent machine learning area. Existing methods, however, are facing open challenges in how to enrich model expressiveness and reduce computational complexity for scalability. This paper addresses both challenges with a novel approach that uses a multi-layer/hop neural network to model a hidden space, and the ﬁrst-order Chebyshev approximation to reduce training time complexity. Our experiments on benchmark datasets for collaborative ﬁltering, citation network analysis, course prerequisite prediction and drug-target interaction prediction show the advantageous performance of the proposed approach over several state-of-the-art methods.

An Ontology-Driven Approach for Integrating Intelligence to Manage Human and Ecological Health Risks in the Geospatial Sensor Web. Abstract: Due to the rapid installation of a massive number of fixed and mobile sensors, monitoring machines are intentionally or unintentionally involved in the production of a large amount of geospatial data. Environmental sensors and related software applications are rapidly altering human lifestyles and even impacting ecological and human health. However, there are rarely specific geospatial sensor web (GSW) applications for certain ecological public health questions. In this paper, we propose an ontology-driven approach for integrating intelligence to manage human and ecological health risks in the GSW. We design a Human and Ecological health Risks Ontology (HERO) based on a semantic sensor network ontology template. We also illustrate a web-based prototype, the Human and Ecological Health Risk Management System (HaEHMS), which helps health experts and decision makers to estimate human and ecological health risks. We demonstrate this intelligent system through a case study of automatic prediction of air quality and related health risk.

Abstract: Since the American psychologist Reber designed and used the micro-miniature artificial grammar-learning paradigm for the first time in 1967, it has already had a history of half a century. This paper mainly discusses micro-artificial grammar development of four types (classic micro-artificial grammar learning of finite state grammar; micro-artificial grammar learning of finite state grammar without semantics; micro-artificial grammar learning of non-finite state grammar with adjustable semantics; and micro-artificial grammar learning of “mini” natural language) and their further significance in the field of language learning.

Abstract: Detecting the emergence of abrupt property changes in time series is a challenging problem. Kernel two-sample test has been studied for this task which makes fewer assumptions on the distributions than traditional parametric approaches. However, selecting kernels is non-trivial in practice. Although kernel selection for two-sample test has been studied, the insufficient samples in change point detection problem hinder the success of those developed kernel selection algorithms. In this paper, we propose KL-CPD, a novel kernel learning framework for time series CPD that optimizes a lower bound of test power via an auxiliary generative model. With deep kernel parameterization, KL-CPD endows kernel two-sample test with the data-driven kernel to detect different types of change-points in real-world applications. The proposed approach significantly outperformed other state-of-the-art methods in our comparative evaluation of benchmark datasets and simulation studies.

Abstract: This work presents a fully integrated system for reliable grasping and manipulation using dense visual mapping, collision-free motion planning, and shared autonomy. The particular motion sequences are composed automatically based on high-level objectives provided by a human operator, with continuous scene monitoring during execution automatically detecting and adapting to dynamic changes of the environment. The system is able to automatically recover from a variety of disturbances and fall back to the operator if stuck or if it cannot otherwise guarantee safety. Furthermore, the operator can take control at any time and then resume autonomous operation. Our system is flexible to be adapted to new robotic systems, and we demonstrate our work on two real-world platforms — fixed and floating base — in shared workspace scenarios. To the best of our knowledge, this work is also the first to employ the inverse Dynamic Reachability Map for real-time, optimized mobile base positioning to maximize workspace manipulability reducing cycle time and increasing planning and autonomy robustness.

Abstract: Extreme multi-label text classification (XMTC) refers to the problem of assigning to each document its most relevant subset of class labels from an extremely large label collection, where the number of labels could reach hundreds of thousands or millions. The huge label space raises research challenges such as data sparsity and scalability. Significant progress has been made in recent years by the development of new machine learning methods, such as tree induction with large-margin partitions of the instance spaces and label-vector embedding in the target space. However, deep learning has not been explored for XMTC, despite its big successes in other related areas. This paper presents the first attempt at applying deep learning to XMTC, with a family of new Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models which are tailored for multi-label classification in particular. With a comparative evaluation of 7 state-of-the-art methods on 6 benchmark datasets where the number of labels is up to 670,000, we show that the proposed CNN approach successfully scaled to the largest datasets, and consistently produced the best or the second best results on all the datasets. On the Wikipedia dataset with over 2 million documents and 500,000 labels in particular, it outperformed the second best method by 11.7%~15.3% in precision@K and by 11.5%~11.7% in NDCG@K for K = 1,3,5.
- Guoqing Zheng, Yiming Yang, J. Carbonell. 2017. Asymmetric Variational Autoencoders.. Abstract: Variational inference for latent variable models is prevalent in various machine learning problems, typically solved by maximizing the Evidence Lower Bound (ELBO) of the true data likelihood with respect to a variational distribution. However, freely enriching the family of variational distribution is challenging since the ELBO requires variational likelihood evaluations of the latent variables. In this paper, we propose a novel framework to enrich the variational family by incorporating auxiliary variables to the variational family. The resulting inference network doesn't require density evaluations for the auxiliary variables and thus complex implicit densities over the auxiliary variables can be constructed by neural networks. It can be shown that the actual variational posterior of the proposed approach is essentially modeling a rich probabilistic mixture of simple variational posterior indexed by auxiliary variables, thus a flexible inference model can be built. Empirical evaluations on several density estimation tasks demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed method.

Abstract: —We present the Hierarchical Dynamic Roadmap (HDRM), a novel resolution complete motion planning algorithm for solving complex planning problems. A unique hierarchical structure is proposed for efﬁciently encoding the conﬁguration-to-workspace occupation information that allows the robot to check the collision state of tens of millions of samples on-the-ﬂy— the number of which was previously strictly limited by available memory. The hierarchical structure also signiﬁcantly reduces the time for path searching, hence the robot is able to ﬁnd feasible motion plans in real-time in extremely constrained environments. The HDRM is theoretically proven to be resolution complete, with a rigorous benchmarking showing that HDRM is robust and computationally fast, compared to classical dynamic roadmap methods and other state-of-the-art planning algorithms. Experiments on the 7 degree-of-freedom KUKA LWR robotic arm integrated with real-time perception of the environment further validate the effectiveness of HDRM in complex environments.

- Wei-Cheng Chang, Yuexin Wu, Hanxiao Liu, Yiming Yang. 2017. Cross-Domain Kernel Induction for Transfer Learning. Abstract: 
 
 The key question in transfer learning (TL) research is how to make model induction transferable across different domains. Common methods so far require source and target domains to have a shared/homogeneous feature space, or the projection of features from heterogeneous domains onto a shared space. This paper proposes a novel framework, which does not require a shared feature space but instead uses a parallel corpus to calibrate domain-specific kernels into a unified kernel, to leverage graph-based label propagation in cross-domain settings, and to optimize semi-supervised learning based on labeled and unlabeled data in both source and target domains. Our experiments on benchmark datasets show advantageous performance of the proposed method over that of other state-of-the-art TL methods.

Abstract: Multivariate time series forecasting is an important machine learning problem across many domains, including predictions of solar plant energy output, electricity consumption, and traffic jam situation. Temporal data arise in these real-world applications often involves a mixture of long-term and short-term patterns, for which traditional approaches such as Autoregressive models and Gaussian Process may fail. In this paper, we proposed a novel deep learning framework, namely Long- and Short-term Time-series network (LSTNet), to address this open challenge. LSTNet uses the Convolution Neural Network (CNN) and the Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) to extract short-term local dependency patterns among variables and to discover long-term patterns for time series trends. Furthermore, we leverage traditional autoregressive model to tackle the scale insensitive problem of the neural network model. In our evaluation on real-world data with complex mixtures of repetitive patterns, LSTNet achieved significant performance improvements over that of several state-of-the-art baseline methods. All the data and experiment codes are available online.

Abstract: Variational inference for latent variable models is prevalent in various machine learning problems, typically solved by maximizing the Evidence Lower Bound (ELBO) of the true data likelihood with respect to a variational distribution. However, freely enriching the family of variational distribution is challenging since the ELBO requires variational likelihood evaluations of the latent variables. In this paper, we propose a novel framework to enrich the variational family based on an alternative lower bound, by introducing auxiliary random variables to the variational distribution only. While offering a much richer family of complex variational distributions, the resulting inference network is likelihood almost free in the sense that only the latent variables require evaluations from simple likelihoods and samples from all the auxiliary variables are sufficient for maximum likelihood inference. We show that the proposed approach is essentially optimizing a probabilistic mixture of ELBOs, thus enriching modeling capacity and enhancing robustness. It outperforms state-of-the-art methods in our experiments on several density estimation tasks.
- Ruochen Xu, Yiming Yang. 2017. Cross-lingual Distillation for Text Classification. Abstract: Cross-lingual text classification(CLTC) is the task of classifying documents written in different languages into the same taxonomy of categories. This paper presents a novel approach to CLTC that builds on model distillation, which adapts and extends a framework originally proposed for model compression. Using soft probabilistic predictions for the documents in a label-rich language as the (induced) supervisory labels in a parallel corpus of documents, we train classifiers successfully for new languages in which labeled training data are not available. An adversarial feature adaptation technique is also applied during the model training to reduce distribution mismatch. We conducted experiments on two benchmark CLTC datasets, treating English as the source language and German, French, Japan and Chinese as the unlabeled target languages. The proposed approach had the advantageous or comparable performance of the other state-of-art methods.

Abstract: We present RACE, a new dataset for benchmark evaluation of methods in the reading comprehension task. Collected from the English exams for middle and high school Chinese students in the age range between 12 to 18, RACE consists of near 28,000 passages and near 100,000 questions generated by human experts (English instructors), and covers a variety of topics which are carefully designed for evaluating the students’ ability in understanding and reasoning. In particular, the proportion of questions that requires reasoning is much larger in RACE than that in other benchmark datasets for reading comprehension, and there is a significant gap between the performance of the state-of-the-art models (43%) and the ceiling human performance (95%). We hope this new dataset can serve as a valuable resource for research and evaluation in machine comprehension.

Abstract: A key prerequisite for planning manipulation together with locomotion of humanoids in complex environments is to find a valid end-pose with a feasible stance location and a full-body configuration that is balanced and collision-free. Prior work based on the inverse dynamic reachability map assumed that the feet are placed next to each other around the stance location on a horizontal plane, and the success rate was correlated with the coverage density of the sampled space, which in turn is limited by the memory required for storing the map. In this letter, we present a framework that uses a paired forward-inverse dynamic reachability map to exploit a greater modularity of the robot's inherent kinematic structure. The combinatorics of this novel decomposition allows greater coverage in the high-dimensional configuration space while reducing the number of stored samples. This permits drawing samples from a much richer dataset to effectively plan end-poses for both single-handed and bimanual tasks on uneven terrains. This novel method was demonstrated on the 38-DoF NASA Valkyrie humanoid by utilizing and exploiting whole body redundancy for accomplishing manipulation tasks on uneven terrains while avoiding obstacles.

Abstract: Software architects inhabit a complex, rapidly evolving technological landscape. An ever growing collection of competing architecturally significant technologies, ranging from distributed databases to middleware and cloud platforms, makes rigorously comparing alternatives and selecting appropriate solutions a daunting engineering task. To address this problem, we envisage an ecosystem of curated, automatically updated knowledge bases that enable straightforward and streamlined technical comparisons of related products. These knowledge bases would emulate engineering handbooks that are commonly found in other engineering disciplines. As a first step towards this vision, we have built a curated knowledge base for comparing distributed databases based on a semantically defined feature taxonomy. We report in this paper on the initial results of using supervised machine learning to assist with knowledge base curation. Our results show immense promise in recommending Web pages that are highly relevant to curators. We also describe the major obstacles, both practical and scientific, that our work has uncovered. These must be overcome by future research in order to make our vision of curated knowledge bases a reality.

Abstract: This paper presents an estimation scheme to control foot placement for achieving a desired dynamic walking velocity in presence of sensor and model errors. Inevitable discrepancies, such as sensors5 noise, delay, and modelling errors, degrade the performance of model-based control methods or even cause instabilities. To resolve these issues, an on-line parameter estimation approach based on Tikhonov regularisation is formulated using measurement data, which is particularly robust for more accurately approximating the dynamics. The proposed scheme initially uses the foot placement predicted by the linear inverted pendulum model, while the control parameters are being optimised using adequate measurements to represent the real dynamics within and in-between steps; and then, the estimation based control is used to predict the future foot placement accurately in the presence of discrepancies.

Abstract: This paper presents a new multitask learning framework that learns a shared representation among the tasks, incorporating both task and feature clusters. The jointly-induced clusters yield a shared latent subspace where task relationships are learned more effectively and more generally than in state-of-the-art multitask learning methods. The proposed general framework enables the derivation of more specific or restricted state-of-the-art multitask methods. The paper also proposes a highly-scalable multitask learning algorithm, based on the new framework, using conjugate gradient descent and generalized \textit{Sylvester equations}. Experimental results on synthetic and benchmark datasets show that the proposed method systematically outperforms several state-of-the-art multitask learning methods.
- Guoqing Zheng, Yiming Yang, J. Carbonell. 2017. Convolutional Normalizing Flows. Abstract: Bayesian posterior inference is prevalent in various machine learning problems. Variational inference provides one way to approximate the posterior distribution, however its expressive power is limited and so is the accuracy of resulting approximation. Recently, there has a trend of using neural networks to approximate the variational posterior distribution due to the flexibility of neural network architecture. One way to construct flexible variational distribution is to warp a simple density into a complex by normalizing flows, where the resulting density can be analytically evaluated. However, there is a trade-off between the flexibility of normalizing flow and computation cost for efficient transformation. In this paper, we propose a simple yet effective architecture of normalizing flows, ConvFlow, based on convolution over the dimensions of random input vector. Experiments on synthetic and real world posterior inference problems demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed method.

Abstract: Convolution Neural Network (CNN) has gained tremendous success in computer vision tasks with its outstanding ability to capture the local latent features. Recently, there has been an increasing interest in extending convolution operations to the non-Euclidean geometry. Although various types of convolution operations have been proposed for graphs or manifolds, their connections with traditional convolution over grid-structured data are not well-understood. In this paper, we show that depthwise separable convolution can be successfully generalized for the unification of both graph-based and grid-based convolution methods. Based on this insight we propose a novel Depthwise Separable Graph Convolution (DSGC) approach which is compatible with the tradition convolution network and subsumes existing convolution methods as special cases. It is equipped with the combined strengths in model expressiveness, compatibility (relatively small number of parameters), modularity and computational efficiency in training. Extensive experiments show the outstanding performance of DSGC in comparison with strong baselines on multi-domain benchmark datasets.
- Chun-Liang Li, Wei-Cheng Chang, Yu Cheng, Yiming Yang, B. Póczos. 2017. MMD GAN: Towards Deeper Understanding of Moment Matching Network. Abstract: Generative moment matching network (GMMN) is a deep generative model that differs from Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) by replacing the discriminator in GAN with a two-sample test based on kernel maximum mean discrepancy (MMD). Although some theoretical guarantees of MMD have been studied, the empirical performance of GMMN is still not as competitive as that of GAN on challenging and large benchmark datasets. The computational efficiency of GMMN is also less desirable in comparison with GAN, partially due to its requirement for a rather large batch size during the training. In this paper, we propose to improve both the model expressiveness of GMMN and its computational efficiency by introducing adversarial kernel learning techniques, as the replacement of a fixed Gaussian kernel in the original GMMN. The new approach combines the key ideas in both GMMN and GAN, hence we name it MMD GAN. The new distance measure in MMD GAN is a meaningful loss that enjoys the advantage of weak topology and can be optimized via gradient descent with relatively small batch sizes. In our evaluation on multiple benchmark datasets, including MNIST, CIFAR- 10, CelebA and LSUN, the performance of MMD-GAN significantly outperforms GMMN, and is competitive with other representative GAN works.

Abstract: Large-scale multi-relational embedding refers to the task of learning the latent representations for entities and relations in large knowledge graphs. An effective and scalable solution for this problem is crucial for the true success of knowledge-based inference in a broad range of applications. This paper proposes a novel framework for optimizing the latent representations with respect to the \textit{analogical} properties of the embedded entities and relations. By formulating the learning objective in a differentiable fashion, our model enjoys both theoretical power and computational scalability, and significantly outperformed a large number of representative baseline methods on benchmark datasets. Furthermore, the model offers an elegant unification of several well-known methods in multi-relational embedding, which can be proven to be special instantiations of our framework.

Abstract: Large-scale kernel approximation is an important problem in machine learning research. Approaches using random Fourier features have become increasingly popular [Rahimi and Recht, 2007], where kernel approximation is treated as empirical mean estimation via Monte Carlo (MC) or Quasi-Monte Carlo (QMC) integration [Yang et al., 2014]. A limitation of the current approaches is that all the features receive an equal weight summing to 1. In this paper, we propose a novel shrinkage estimator from "Stein effect", which provides a data-driven weighting strategy for random features and enjoys theoretical justifications in terms of lowering the empirical risk. We further present an efficient randomized algorithm for large-scale applications of the proposed method. Our empirical results on six benchmark data sets demonstrate the advantageous performance of this approach over representative baselines in both kernel approximation and supervised learning tasks.

Abstract: Planning balanced and collision-free motion for humanoid robots is non-trivial, especially when they are operated in complex environments, such as reaching targets behind obstacles or through narrow passages. Research has been done in particular to plan such complex motion on humanoids, however, these approaches are typically restricted to particular robot platforms and environments, which can not be easily replicated nor applied. We propose a method that allows us to apply existing sampling-based algorithms directly to plan trajectories for humanoids by utilizing a customized state space representation, biased sampling strategies, and a steering function based on a robust inverse kinematics solver. Our approach requires no prior offline computation, thus one can easily transfer the work to new robot platforms. We tested the proposed method by solving practical reaching tasks on a 38 degrees-of-freedom humanoid robot, NASA Valkyrie, showing that our method is able to generate valid motion plans that can be executed on advanced full-size humanoid robots.

Abstract: Event extraction has become one of the most important topics in information extraction, but to date, there is very limited work on leveraging cross-lingual training to boost performance. We propose a new event extraction approach that trains on multiple languages using a combination of both language-dependent and language-independent features, with particular focus on the case where target domain training data is of very limited size. We show empirically that multilingual training can boost performance for the tasks of event trigger extraction and event argument extraction on the Chinese ACE 2005 dataset.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel inverse Dynamic Reachability Map (iDRM) that allows a floating base system to find valid and sufficient end-poses in complex and changing environments in real-time. End-pose planning, i.e. finding valid stance locations and collision-free reaching configurations, is an essential problem in humanoid applications, such as providing goal states for walking and motion planners. However, it is non-trivial in complex environments, where standing locations and reaching postures are restricted by obstacles. Our proposed approach, iDRM, customizes the robot-to-workspace occupation list and uses an online update algorithm to enable efficient reconstruction of the reachability map to guarantee that the selected end-poses are always collision-free. The iDRM was evaluated in a variety of reaching tasks using the 38 degree-of-freedom (DoF) humanoid robot Valkyrie. Our results show that the approach is capable of finding valid end-poses in a fraction of a second.

Abstract: This paper addresses an open challenge in educational data mining, i.e., the problem of automatically mapping online courses from different providers (universities, MOOCs, etc.) onto a universal space of concepts, and predicting latent prerequisite dependencies (directed links) among both concepts and courses. We propose a novel approach for inference within and across course-level and concept-level directed graphs. In the training phase, our system projects partially observed course-level prerequisite links onto directed concept-level links; in the testing phase, the induced concept-level links are used to infer the unknown course-level prerequisite links. Whereas courses may be specific to one institution, concepts are shared across different providers. The bi-directional mappings enable our system to perform interlingua-style transfer learning, e.g. treating the concept graph as the interlingua and transferring the prerequisite relations across universities via the interlingua. Experiments on our newly collected datasets of courses from MIT, Caltech, Princeton and CMU show promising results.

Abstract: Droplet-based microfluidics has recently emerged as a potential platform for studies of single-cell, directed evolution, and genetic sequencing. In droplet-based microfluidics, adding reagents into drops is one of the most important functions. In this paper, we develop a new self-triggered picoinjector to add controlled volumes of reagent into droplets at kilohertz rates. In the picoinjector, the reagent injecting is triggered by the coming droplet itself, without needing a droplet detection module. Meanwhile, the dosing volume can be precisely controlled. These features make the system more practical and reliable. We expect the new picoinjector will find important applications of droplet-based microfluidics in automated biological assay, directed evolution, enzyme assay, and so on.

- Devendra Singh Chaplot, Yiming Yang, J. Carbonell, K. Koedinger. 2016. Data-driven Automated Induction of Prerequisite Structure Graphs. Abstract: With the growing popularity of MOOCs and sharp trend of digitalizing education, there is a huge amount of free digital educational material on the web along with the activity logs of large number of participating students. However, this data is largely unstructured and there is hardly any information about the relationship between material from diﬀerent sources. We propose a generic algorithm to use educational material and student activity data from heterogeneous sources to create a Prerequisite Structure Graph (PSG). A PSG is a directed acyclic graph, where the nodes are educational units and the edges specify the pairwise ordering of the units in eﬀective teaching by instructors or for eﬀective learning by students. We propose an unsupervised approach utilizing both text content and student data, which outperforms to supervised methods (utilizing only text content) on the task of estimating a PSG.
- Hanxiao Liu, Yiming Yang. 2016. Cross-Graph Learning of Multi-Relational Associations. Abstract: Cross-graph Relational Learning (CGRL) refers to the problem of predicting the strengths or labels of multi-relational tuples of heterogeneous object types, through the joint inference over multiple graphs which specify the internal connections among each type of objects. CGRL is an open challenge in machine learning due to the daunting number of all possible tuples to deal with when the numbers of nodes in multiple graphs are large, and because the labeled training instances are extremely sparse as typical. Existing methods such as tensor factorization or tensor-kernel machines do not work well because of the lack of convex formulation for the optimization of CGRL models, the poor scalability of the algorithms in handling combinatorial numbers of tuples, and/or the non-transductive nature of the learning methods which limits their ability to leverage unlabeled data in training. This paper proposes a novel framework which formulates CGRL as a convex optimization problem, enables transductive learning using both labeled and unlabeled tuples, and offers a scalable algorithm that guarantees the optimal solution and enjoys a linear time complexity with respect to the sizes of input graphs. In our experiments with a subset of DBLP publication records and an Enzyme multi-source dataset, the proposed method successfully scaled to the large cross-graph inference problem, and outperformed other representative approaches significantly.

Abstract: Cross-lingual text classification (CLTC) refers to the task of classifying documents in different languages into the same taxonomy of categories. An open challenge in CLTC is to classify documents for the languages where labeled training data are not available. Existing approaches rely on the availability of either high-quality machine translation of documents (to the languages where massively training data are available), or rich bilingual dictionaries for effective translation of trained classification models (to the languages where labeled training data are lacking). This paper studies the CLTC challenge under the assumption that neither condition is met. That is, we focus on the problem of translating classification models with highly incomplete bilingual dictionaries. Specifically, we propose two new approaches that combines unsupervised word embedding in different languages, supervised mapping of embedded words across languages, and probabilistic translation of classification models. The approaches show significant performance improvement in CLTC on a benchmark corpus of Reuters news stories (RCV1/RCV2) in English, Spanish, German, French and Chinese and an internal dataset in Uzbek, compared to representative baseline methods using conventional bilingual dictionaries or highly incomplete ones.

- Guoqing Zheng, Yiming Yang, J. Carbonell. 2016. Efficient Shift-Invariant Dictionary Learning. Abstract: Shift-invariant dictionary learning (SIDL) refers to the problem of discovering a set of latent basis vectors (the dictionary) that captures informative local patterns at different locations of the input sequences, and a sparse coding for each sequence as a linear combination of the latent basis elements. It differs from conventional dictionary learning and sparse coding where the latent basis has the same dimension as the input vectors, where the focus is on global patterns instead of shift-invariant local patterns. Unsupervised discovery of shift-invariant dictionary and the corresponding sparse coding has been an open challenge as the number of candidate local patterns is extremely large, and the number of possible linear combinations of such local patterns is even more so. In this paper we propose a new framework for unsupervised discovery of both the shift-invariant basis and the sparse coding of input data, with efficient algorithms for tractable optimization. Empirical evaluations on multiple time series data sets demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed method.

Abstract: Automatic ground filtering for Light Detection and Ranging data is a critical process for the creation of Digital Terrain Models. Several methods have been developed for filtering Light Detection and Ranging data and some improvements have been made but the problem has not been fully solved for the complicated landscape types and abrupt surfaces. In this paper, the region growing algorithm is introduced into the slope-based algorithm. A probabilistic function is introduced and the index of probability is used to further eliminate the pseudo ground points. A comprehensive test of the performance on nine study sites is conducted and compared with the results of seven other published methods based on the Kappa coefficients and the total errors. Overall, the slope-based and region growing algorithm performs the best in urban areas compared with other filtering methods published in terms of average Kappa value and total errors. The slope-based and region growing algorithm is adaptive to the thresholds of the slope and the filtering window, two commonly required parameters. The complexity of terrain does not significantly influence the performance of the slope-based and region growing algorithm, which allows it to be adopted in different terrains for urban areas.

Abstract: With the explosive growth of Web pages appearing in the Internet and mobile Internet, it is quite challenging for Web search engines to provide users with desirable results from large amount of data. One of important problems for improving the service in search engines is web page classification. For this problem, current approaches usually first extract features from Web pages and then use traditional machine learning methods for training process. However, these methods usually are time-consuming and do not take incremental learning into consideration at all, thus they may not be suitable for online applications. Therefore, in this paper we rethink the problem of Web page classification by only using URLs and propose an efficient Url-Pattern based Classification Algorithm (named UPCA). Specifically, given a set of training samples with the same label, we first construct a pattern tree and extract main patterns from it. Then we can classify new Web pages by matching their URLs to the patterns. Also, we propose an efficient incremental pattern-tree algorithm. Experimental results show that the proposed approach achieves very promising performance, in terms of both classification accuracy and computational efficiency.
- Hanxiao Liu, Yiming Yang. 2015. Bipartite Edge Prediction via Transductive Learning over Product Graphs. Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of predicting the missing edges of a bipartite graph where each side of the vertices has its own intrinsic structure. We propose a new optimization framework to map the two sides of the intrinsic structures onto the manifold structure of the edges via a graph product, and to reduce the original problem to vertex label propagation over the product graph. This framework enjoys flexible choices in the formulation of graph products, and supports a rich family of graph transduction schemes with scalable inference. Experiments on benchmark datasets for collaborative filtering, citation network analysis and prerequisite prediction of online courses show advantageous performance of the proposed approach over other state-of-the-art methods.

Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase IIγ enhances stem-like traits and tumorigenicity of lung cancer cells. Abstract: Highly tumorigenic stem-like cells, considered tumor-initiating cells (TICs), are the main cause of lung cancer initiation, relapse, and drug resistance. In this study, we identified that Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase IIγ (CaMKIIγ) was aberrantly expressed in highly tumorigenic stem-like lung cancer cells, and was also correlated with poor prognosis in human lung cancer. Functionally, CaMKIIγ enhanced stem-like traits and the tumorigenicity of lung cancer cells in an Akt- and β-catenin-dependent manner. In addition, we found that CaMKIIγ upregulated Oct4 expression via Akt-mediated histone acetylation. Taken together, our findings reveal a critical role of CaMKIIγ in regulating the stemness and tumorigenicity of lung cancer cells and offer a promising therapeutic target for TICs.
- Yiming Yang, Hanxiao Liu, J. Carbonell, Wanli Ma. 2015. Concept Graph Learning from Educational Data. Abstract: This paper addresses an open challenge in educational data mining, i.e., the problem of using observed prerequisite relations among courses to learn a directed universal concept graph, and using the induced graph to predict unobserved prerequisite relations among a broader range of courses. This is particularly useful to induce prerequisite relations among courses from different providers (universities, MOOCs, etc.). We propose a new framework for inference within and across two graphs---at the course level and at the induced concept level---which we call Concept Graph Learning (CGL). In the training phase, our system projects the course-level links onto the concept space to induce directed concept links; in the testing phase, the concept links are used to predict (unobserved) prerequisite links for test-set courses within the same institution or across institutions. The dual mappings enable our system to perform an interlingua-style transfer learning, e.g. treating the concept graph as the interlingua, and inducing prerequisite links in a transferable manner across different universities. Experiments on our newly collected data sets of courses from MIT, Caltech, Princeton and CMU show promising results, including the viability of CGL for transfer learning.
- Siddharth Gopal, Yiming Yang. 2015. Hierarchical Bayesian Inference and Recursive Regularization for Large-Scale Classification. Abstract: In this article, we address open challenges in large-scale classification, focusing on how to effectively leverage the dependency structures (hierarchical or graphical) among class labels, and how to make the inference scalable in jointly optimizing all model parameters. We propose two main approaches, namely the hierarchical Bayesian inference framework and the recursive regularization scheme. The key idea in both approaches is to reinforce the similarity among parameter across the nodes in a hierarchy or network based on the proximity and connectivity of the nodes. For scalability, we develop hierarchical variational inference algorithms and fast dual coordinate descent training procedures with parallelization. In our experiments for classification problems with hundreds of thousands of classes and millions of training instances with terabytes of parameters, the proposed methods show consistent and statistically significant improvements over other competing approaches, and the best results on multiple benchmark datasets for large-scale classification.
- D. Kapur, Yiming Yang. 2015. An Algorithm to Check Whether a Basis of a Parametric Polynomial System is a Comprehensive Gröbner Basis and the Associated Completion Algorithm. Abstract: Given a basis of a parametric polynomial ideal, an algorithm is proposed to test whether it is a comprehensive Gröbner basis or not. A basis of a parametric polynomial ideal is a comprehensive Gröbner basis if and only if for every specialization of parameters in a given field, the specialization of the basis is a Gröbner basis of the associated specialized polynomial ideal. In case a basis does not check to be a comprehensive Gröbner basis, a completion algorithm for generating a comprehensive Gröbner basis from it that is patterned after Buchberger's algorithm is proposed. Its termination is proved and its correctness is established. In contrast to other algorithms for computing a comprehensive Gröbner basis which first compute a comprehensive Gröbner system and then extract a comprehensive Gröbner basis from it, the proposed algorithm computes a comprehensive Gröbner basis directly. Further, the proposed completion algorithm always computes a minimal faithful comprehensive Gröbner basis in the sense that every polynomial in the result is from the ideal as well as essential with respect to the comprehensive Gröbner basis. A prototype implementation of the algorithm has been successfully tried on many examples from the literature. An interesting and somewhat surprising outcome of using the proposed algorithm is that there are example parametric ideals for which a minimal comprehensive Gröbner basis computed by it is different from minimal comprehensive Gröbner bases computed by other algorithms in the literature.

Abstract: Exploiting structure is essential to an understanding of motion planning. Here, we exploit the topology of the environment to discover connected components. Inside a connected component, instead of planning one trajectory in configuration space, motion planning can be seen as optimizing a set of homotopically equivalent particle trajectories. In this paper, we will concentrate on the problem of motion planning for a humanoid robot. Our contributions are: i) finding the homotopy classes of a single footstep trajectory in an environment, ii) finding a single footstep trajectory in a single homotopy class formulated as a convex optimization problem, and iii) finding a feasible upper body trajectory given a footstep trajectory, formulated as a set of convex optimization problems. This view provides us with important insights into the difficulty of motion planning, and – under some assumptions – allows us to provide the number of local minima of a given motion planning problem. We demonstrate our approach on a real humanoid platform with 36-dof in a highly restricted environment.
- Yiming Yang, V. Ivan, S. Vijayakumar. 2015. Real-time motion adaptation using relative distance space representation. Abstract: Reacting to environment changes is a big challenge for real world robot applications. This paper presents a novel approach that allows the robot to quickly adapt to changes, particularly in the presence of moving targets and dynamic obstacles. Typically, a configuration space replanning or adaptation is required if the environment is changed. Rather, our method aims to maintain a plan, in a relative distance space rather than configuration space, that can be valid in different environments. In addition, we introduce an incremental planning structure that allows us to handle unexpected obstacles that may appear during execution. The main contribution is that the relative distance space representation encodes pose re-targeting, reaching and avoiding tasks within one unified cost term that can be solved in real-time to achieve a fast implementation for high degree of freedom (DOF) robots. We evaluate our method on a 7 DOF LWR robot arm, and a 14 DOF dual-arm Baxter robot.

- Siddharth Gopal, Yiming Yang. 2014. Transformation-based Probabilistic Clustering with Supervision. Abstract: One of the common problems with clustering is that the generated clusters often do not match user expectations. This paper proposes a novel probabilistic framework that exploits supervised information in a discriminative and transferable manner to generate better clustering of unlabeled data. The supervision is provided by revealing the cluster assignments for some subset of the ground truth clusters and is used to learn a transformation of the data such that labeled instances form well-separated clusters with respect to the given clustering objective. This estimated transformation function enables us to fold the remaining unlabeled data into a space where new clusters hopefully match user expectations. While our framework is general, in this paper, we focus on its application to Gaussian and von Mises-Fisher mixture models. Extensive testing on 23 data sets across several application domains revealed substantial improvement in performance over competing methods.
- Siddharth Gopal, Yiming Yang. 2014. Von Mises-Fisher Clustering Models. Abstract: This paper proposes a suite of models for clustering high-dimensional data on a unit sphere based on von Mises-Fisher (vMF) distribution and for discovering more intuitive clusters than existing approaches. The proposed models include a) A Bayesian formulation of vMF mixture that enables information sharing among clusters, b) a Hierarchical vMF mixture that provides multiscale shrinkage and tree structured view of the data and c) a Temporal vMF mixture that captures evolution of clusters in temporal data. For posterior inference, we develop fast variational methods as well as collapsed Gibbs sampling techniques for all three models. Our experiments on six datasets provide strong empirical support in favour of vMF based clustering models over other popular tools such as K-means, Multinomial Mixtures and Latent Dirichlet Allocation
- Siddharth Gopal, Yiming Yang. 2013. Distributed training of Large-scale Logistic models. Abstract: Regularized Multinomial Logistic regression has emerged as one of the most common methods for performing data classification and analysis. With the advent of large-scale data it is common to find scenarios where the number of possible multinomial outcomes is large (in the order of thousands to tens of thousands) and the dimensionality is high. In such cases, the computational cost of training logistic models or even simply iterating through all the model parameters is prohibitively expensive. In this paper, we propose a training method for large-scale multinomial logistic models that breaks this bottleneck by enabling parallel optimization of the likelihood objective. Our experiments on large-scale datasets showed an order of magnitude reduction in training time.
- Siddharth Gopal, Yiming Yang. 2013. Recursive regularization for large-scale classification with hierarchical and graphical dependencies. Abstract: The two key challenges in hierarchical classification are to leverage the hierarchical dependencies between the class-labels for improving performance, and, at the same time maintaining scalability across large hierarchies. In this paper we propose a regularization framework for large-scale hierarchical classification that addresses both the problems. Specifically, we incorporate the hierarchical dependencies between the class-labels into the regularization structure of the parameters thereby encouraging classes nearby in the hierarchy to share similar model parameters. Furthermore, we extend our approach to scenarios where the dependencies between the class-labels are encoded in the form of a graph rather than a hierarchy. To enable large-scale training, we develop a parallel-iterative optimization scheme that can handle datasets with hundreds of thousands of classes and millions of instances and learning terabytes of parameters. Our experiments showed a consistent improvement over other competing approaches and achieved state-of-the-art results on benchmark datasets.
- Konstantin Salomatin, Tie-Yan Liu, Yiming Yang. 2012. A unified optimization framework for auction and guaranteed delivery in online advertising. Abstract: This paper proposes a new unified optimization framework combining pay-per-click auctions and guaranteed delivery in sponsored search. Advertisers usually have different (and sometimes mixed) marketing goals: brand awareness and direct response. Different mechanisms are good at addressing different goals, e.g., guaranteed delivery was often used to build brand awareness and pay-per-click auctions was widely used for direct marketing. Our new method accommodates both in a unified framework, with the search engine revenue as an optimization objective. In this way, we can target a guaranteed number of ad clicks (or impressions) per campaign for advertisers willing to pay a premium and enable keyword auctions for all others. Specifically, we formulate this joint optimization problem using linear programming and a column generation strategy for efficiency. To select the best column (a ranked list of ads) given a query, we propose a novel dynamic programming algorithm that takes the special structure of the ad allocation and pricing mechanisms into account. We have tested the proposed framework and the algorithms on real ad data obtained from a commercial search engine. The results demonstrate that our proposed approach can outperform several baselines in guaranteeing the number of clicks for the given advertisers, and in increasing the total revenue for the search engine.
- Siddharth Gopal, Yiming Yang, Bing Bai, Alexandru Niculescu-Mizil. 2012. Bayesian models for Large-scale Hierarchical Classification. Abstract: A challenging problem in hierarchical classification is to leverage the hierarchical relations among classes for improving classification performance. An even greater challenge is to do so in a manner that is computationally feasible for large scale problems. This paper proposes a set of Bayesian methods to model hierarchical dependencies among class labels using multivariate logistic regression. Specifically, the parent-child relationships are modeled by placing a hierarchical prior over the children nodes centered around the parameters of their parents; thereby encouraging classes nearby in the hierarchy to share similar model parameters. We present variational algorithms for tractable posterior inference in these models, and provide a parallel implementation that can comfortably handle large-scale problems with hundreds of thousands of dimensions and tens of thousands of classes. We run a comparative evaluation on multiple large-scale benchmark datasets that highlights the scalability of our approach and shows improved performance over the other state-of-the-art hierarchical methods.

Abstract: In this study we develop a secure allocating processing(SAP) algorithm for the S-FAS scheme [13] to improve the security level and consider its performance using the heterogeneous feature of a large distributed system. The SAP allocation algorithm considers load balancing, delayed effects caused by the workload variance of many consecutive requests, and the heterogeneous feature of the storage nodes in the system. We develop a prototype using the multi-threading technique for the S-FAS scheme with the SAP algorithm to guide the file allocation. We did some experiments and the results show that the proposed solution can not only improve the security level, but also improve the throughput of the distributed storage system with heterogeneous vulnerabilities by using the multi-thread technique.

Abstract: There is a growing demand for large-scale distributed storage systems to support resource sharing and fault tolerance. Although heterogeneity issues of distributed systems have been widely investigated, little attention has yet been paid to security solutions designed for distributed storage systems with heterogeneous vulnerabilities. This fact motivates us to investigate a fragment allocation scheme called S-FAS to improve security of a distributed system where storage sites have a wide variety of vulnerabilities. In the S-FAS approach, we integrate file fragmentation with the secret sharing technique in a distributed storage system with heterogeneous vulnerabilities. Storage sites in a distributed systems are classified into a variety of different server types based on vulnerability characteristics. Given a file and a distributed system, S-FAS allocates fragments of the file to as many different types of nodes as possible in the system. Data confidentiality is preserved because fragments of a file are allocated to multiple storage nodes. We develop storage assurance and dynamic assurance models to evaluate the quality of security offered by S-FAS. Analysis results show that fragment allocations made by S-FAS lead to enhanced security because of the consideration of heterogeneous vulnerabilities in distributed storage systems.
- Yiming Yang, A. Lad. 2011. A framework for evaluation and optimization of relevance and novelty-based retrieval. Abstract: There has been growing interest in building and optimizing retrieval systems with respect to relevance and novelty of information, which together more realistically reflect the usefulness of a system as perceived by the user. How to combine these criteria into a single metric that can be used to measure as well as optimize retrieval systems is an open challenge that has only received partial solutions so far. Unlike relevance, which can be measured independently for each document, the novelty of a document depends on other documents seen by the user during his or her past interaction with the system. This is especially problematic for assessing the retrieval performance across multiple ranked lists, as well as for learning from user's feedback, which must be interpreted with respect to other documents seen by the user. Moreover, users often have different tolerances towards redundancy depending on the nature of their information needs and available time, but this factor is not explicitly modeled by existing approaches for novelty-based retrieval. 
In this thesis, we develop a new framework for evaluating as well as optimizing retrieval systems with respect to their utility, which is measured in terms of relevance and novelty of information. We combine a nugget-based model of utility with a probabilistic model of user behavior; this leads to a flexible metric that generalizes existing evaluation measures. We demonstrate that our framework naturally extends to the evaluation of session-based retrieval while maintaining a consistent definition of novelty across multiple ranked lists. 
Next, we address the complementary problem of optimization, i.e., how to maximize retrieval performance for one or more ranked lists with respect to the proposed measure. Since the system does not have knowledge of the nuggets that are relevant to each query, we propose a ranking approach based on the use of observable query and document features ( e.g., words and named entities) as surrogates for the unknown nuggets, whose weights are automatically learned from user feedback. However, finding the ranked list that maximizes the coverage of a given set of nuggets leads to an NP-hard problem. We take advantage of the sub-modularity of the proposed measure to derive lower bounds on the performance of approximate algorithms, and also conduct experiments to assess the empirical performance of a greedy algorithm under various conditions. 
Our framework provides a strong foundation for modeling retrieval performance in terms of non-independent utility of documents across multiple ranked lists. Moreover, it allows accurate evaluation and optimization of retrieval systems under realistic conditions, and hence, enable rapid development and tuning of new algorithms for novelty-based retrieval without the need for user-centric evaluations involving human subjects, which, although more realistic, are expensive, time-consuming, and risky in a live environment.
- Shinjae Yoo, Yiming Yang, J. Carbonell. 2011. Modeling personalized email prioritization: classification-based and regression-based approaches. Abstract: Email overload, even after spam filtering, presents a serious productivity challenge for busy professionals and executives. One solution is automated prioritization of incoming emails to ensure the most important are read and processed quickly, while others are processed later as/if time permits in declining priority levels. This paper presents a study of machine learning approaches to email prioritization into discrete levels, comparing ordinal regression versus classifier cascades. Given the ordinal nature of discrete email priority levels, SVM ordinal regression would be expected to perform well, but surprisingly a cascade of SVM classifiers significantly outperforms ordinal regression for email prioritization. In contrast, SVM regression performs well -- better than classifiers -- on selected UCI data sets. This unexpected performance inversion is analyzed and results are presented, providing core functionality for email prioritization systems.

- Thesis, Le Zhao, Jamie Callan, Yiming Yang, J. Carbonell. 2011. Modeling and Predicting Term Mismatch for Full-Text Retrieval. Abstract: The probability that a term appears in a relevant document is a fundamental quantity in the theory of probabilistic information retrieval, however prior research provided few clues about how to estimate it reliably. Since this probability measures how likely it is that a term has to appear in a document in order for the document to be relevant, in this thesis, it is called term necessity. Equivalently, it is also the proportion of relevant documents that contain the term, thus measures term recall, or the complement of term mismatch. This thesis uses exploratory data analysis to identify common reasons that user-specified query terms fail to match relevant documents, develops features correlated with each reason, and integrates them into a model that can be trained from data. The resulting term necessity predictions can be used as term weights in state-of-the-art retrieval models to improve retrieval accuracy substantially. Feature-based necessity prediction also supports diagnosis and improvement of query components. The thesis research will develop several forms of diagnosis and intervention. The simplest form is interactive feedback in which potential problems with query components are identified for a person to fix. More nuanced approaches to automatic formulations of structured queries are based on interventions that address different causes of term mismatch. For example, removing unnecessary terms, expanding the terms that are likely to mismatch, and weighting term disjunctions after query expansion. Improved weighting of structured query components also provides a new approach to addressing the field-length biases that persist in state-of-the-art retrieval models for structured documents. Collectively, these interventions leverage term necessity predictions to address a variety of common problems related to formation of effective queries.
- Siddharth Gopal, Yiming Yang, Konstantin Salomatin, J. Carbonell. 2011. Statistical Learning for File-Type Identification. Abstract: File-type Identification (FTI) is an important problem in digital forensics, intrusion detection, and other related fields. Using state-of-the-art classification techniques to solve FTI problems has begun to receive research attention, however, general conclusions have not been reached due to the lack of thorough evaluations for method comparison. This paper presents a systematic investigation of the problem, algorithmic solutions and an evaluation methodology. Our focus is on performance comparison of statistical classifiers (e.g. SVM and kNN) and knowledge-based approaches, especially COTS (Commercial Off-The-Shelf) solutions which currently dominate FTI applications. We analyze the robustness of different methods in handling damaged files and file segments. We propose two alternative criteria in measuring performance: 1) treating file-name extensions as the true labels, and 2) treating the predictions by knowledge based approaches on intact files, these rely on signature bytes as the true labels (and removing these signature bytes before testing each method). In our experiments with simulated damages in files, SVM and kNN substantially outperform all the COTS solutions we tested, improving classification accuracy very substantially -- some COTS methods cannot identify damaged files at all.
- A. Lad, Yiming Yang. 2010. Active Ordering of Interactive Prediction Tasks. Abstract: Many applications involve a set of prediction tasks that must be accomplished sequentially through user interaction. If the tasks are interdependent, the order in which they are posed may have a significant impact on the effective utilization of user feedback by the prediction systems, affecting their overall performance. This paper presents a novel approach for dynamically ordering a series of prediction tasks by taking into account the effect of user feedback on the performance of multiple prediction systems. The proposed approach represents a general strategy for learning incrementally during test phase when the system interacts with the end-user, who expects good performance instead of merely providing correct labels to the system. Therefore, the system must balance system benefit against user benefit when selecting items for user’s attention. We apply the proposed approach to two practical applications that involve interactive trouble report generation and document annotation, respectively. Our experiments show significant improvements in prediction performance (in terms of Mean Average Precision) using the proposed active ordering approach, as compared to baseline approaches that either determine a task order offline and hold it fixed during test phase, or do not optimize the order at all.

Abstract: Improving security and minimizing power consumption are crucial for large-scale data storage systems. Although a handful of studies have been focused on data security and energy efficiency, most of the existing approaches have concentrated on only one of these two metrics. In this aper, we present a new approach to integrating power optimization with security services to enhance the security of energy-efficient large-scale storage systems. In our approach, we make use of the dynamic speed control for power management technique, or DRPM, to conserve energy in secure storage systems. In this study we develop two ways of integrating confidentiality services with the dynamic disk speed control technique. The first strategy - security aggressive in nature - is focused on the improvement of storage system security with less emphasis on energy conservation. The second strategy gives higher priority to energy conservation as opposed to the security optimization. Our experimental results show that the energy-aggressive approach provides better energy savings than the security-aggressive approach. However, the quality of security achieved by the security-aggressive scheme is higher than that of the energy-aggressive approach. Moreover, the empirical results show that energy savings yielded by the two approaches become more pronounced when the data size is increased. The findings illustrate that the response time of the security-aggressive approach is more sensitive to data size than that of the energy-aggressive scheme.

It may also be considered as a problem to determine the subset of terms in training corpus, which maximizes the classifier’s performance. Most of the machine learning algorithms has tainted performance in high dimensional feature space. In this paper, a novel feature selection method based on Ant Colony Optimization, a swarm intelligence algorithm is proposed. Ant Colony Optimization is a metaheuristic algorithm used to increase the ability of finding high quality solutions to NP-hard problems. The heuristic information required for the optimization process is obtained through a chi-square based statistical method, CHIR which results in fast convergence. Performance of the classifier with features selected by proposed method is compared to the feature selected by conventional chi-square and CHIR methods. It is found that the proposed algorithm identifies better feature set than the conventional methods.

Abstract: We consider the problem of learning to rank relevant and novel documents so as to directly maximize a performance metric called Expected Global Utility (EGU), which has several desirable properties: (i) It measures retrieval performance in terms of relevant as well as novel information, (ii) gives more importance to top ranks to reflect common browsing behavior of users, as opposed to existing objective functions based on set-coverage, (iii) accommodates different levels of tolerance towards redundancy, which is not taken into account by existing evaluation measures, and (iv) extends naturally to the evaluation of session-based retrieval comprising multiple ranked lists. Our ground truth is defined in terms of "information nuggets", which are obviously not known to the retrieval system when processing a new user query. Therefore, our approach uses observable query and document features (words and named entities) as surrogates for nuggets, whose weights are learned based on user feedback in an iterative search session. The ranked list is produced to maximize the weighted coverage of these surrogate nuggets. The optimization of such coverage-based metrics is known to be NP-hard. Therefore, we use a greedy algorithm and show that it guarantees good performance due to the submodularity of the objective function. Our experiments on Topic Detection and Tracking data show that the proposed approach represents an efficient and effective retrieval strategy for maximizing EGU, as compared to a purely-relevance based ranking approach that uses Indri, as well as a MMR-based approach for non-redundant ranking.
- Siddharth Gopal, Yiming Yang. 2010. Multilabel classification with meta-level features. Abstract: Effective learning in multi-label classification (MLC) requires an appropriate level of abstraction for representing the relationship between each instance and multiple categories. Current MLC methods have been focused on learning-to-map from instances to ranked lists of categories in a relatively high-dimensional space. The fine-grained features in such a space may not be sufficiently expressive for characterizing discriminative patterns, and worse, make the model complexity unnecessarily high. This paper proposes an alternative approach by transforming conventional representations of instances and categories into a relatively small set of link-based meta-level features, and leveraging successful learning-to-rank retrieval algorithms (e.g., SVM-MAP) over this reduced feature space. Controlled experiments on multiple benchmark datasets show strong empirical evidence for the strength of the proposed approach, as it significantly outperformed several state-of-the-art methods, including Rank-SVM, ML-kNN and IBLR-ML (Instance-based Logistic Regression for Multi-label Classification) in most cases.
- Abhay Harpale, Yiming Yang. 2010. Active Learning for Multi-Task Adaptive Filtering. Abstract: In this paper, we propose an Active Learning (AL) framework for the Multi-Task Adaptive Filtering (MTAF) problem. Specifically, we explore AL approaches to rapidly improve an MTAF system, based on Dirichlet Process priors, with minimal user/task-level feedback. The proposed AL approaches select instances for delivery with a two-fold objective: 1) Improve future task-specific system performance based on feedback received on delivered instances for that task, 2) Improve the future overall system performance, thereby benefiting other tasks in the system, based on feedback received on delivered instances for a particular task. Current AL approaches focus only on the first objective. For satisfying both goals, we define a new scoring function called Utility Gain to estimate the perceived improvements in task-specific and global models. In our experiments on standard benchmark datasets, we observed that global AL approaches that additionally take into account the potential benefit of feedback to other tasks in the system performed better than the task-specific approach that focused only the benefit of the current task.

Abstract: Ice coating in power networks could result in power-tower collapse and power interruption. This paper introduces a preliminary design of deicing robot, which travels on transmission lines and automatically remove ices. Inevitably, the deicing robot will encounter some obstacles. To cross an obstacle, the deicing robot needs to control its arms to grasp transmission line over the obstacle. In this paper, Q-learning, one of reinforcement learning algorithms is applied to study the line-grasping control strategies for deicing robot. We implement a graphical simulation environment and use it to evaluate the Q-learning based line-grasping control policy study algorithm. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm is promising for the line-grasping control of deicing robot.

Abstract: Personalized search systems have evolved to utilize heterogeneous features including document hyperlinks, category labels in various taxonomies and social tags in addition to free-text of the documents. Consequently, classifiers, PageRank algorithms and Collaborative Filtering methods are often used as intermediate steps in such personalized retrieval systems. Thorough comparative evaluation of such complex systems has been difficult due to the lack of appropriate publicly available datasets that provide such diverse feature sets. To remedy the situation, we have created CiteData, a new dataset for benchmark evaluations of personalized search performance, that will be made publicly accessible. CiteData is a collection of academic articles extracted from CiteULike and CiteSeer repositories, with rich feature sets such as authors, author-affiliations, topic labels, social tags and citation information. We further supplement it with personalized queries and relevance judgments which were obtained from volunteer users. This paper starts with a discussion of the design criteria and characteristics of the CiteData dataset in comparison with current benchmark datasets, followed by a set of task-oriented empirical evaluations of popular algorithms in statistical classification, collaborative filtering and link analysis as intermediate steps for personalized search. Our results show significant performance improvement of personalized approaches, over that of unpersonalized approaches. We also observe that a meta personalized search engine that leverages information from multiple sources of features performs better than algorithms that use only one of the constituent source of features.

Abstract: Position changes in Chinese phrase are explained with light verb assumption in Generative Grammar. With regards to the idea that light verb is a hypothetical element, this study attempted to locate the brain areas responsible for positions changes in Chinese phrases and examine whether this processing is launched by light verb or not. The results show that phrases that can change the word positions activated more brain areas than those that can’t change positions of their words. In specific, the left inferior frontal gyrus was shown to be involved a syntactic process, and it is suggested that light verbs are responsible for this process.

DEVELOPING CITEEVAL The technologies and the ideas of Web 2.0 have significantly changed users in thinking and using Web information in their work and other aspects of daily life. More and more Web users, from sophisticated to naïve, are more willing to share online their own ideas, readings, documents, and many other materials. As a result, there is much more potential relevant information in social Web setting for users to search on, at the same time, by knowing more about individual users’ interests, knowledge and preference, it is possible to build personalized search systems to support users’ searches. Personalization has attracted researchers from information retrieval, user modeling, machine learning communities, and has generated many interesting results. However, no reasonable large test collection is yet available for researchers to compare their personalization algorithms.
- Shinjae Yoo, Yiming Yang, Frank Lin, Il-Chul Moon. 2009. Mining social networks for personalized email prioritization. Abstract: Email is one of the most prevalent communication tools today, and solving the email overload problem is pressingly urgent. A good way to alleviate email overload is to automatically prioritize received messages according to the priorities of each user. However, research on statistical learning methods for fully personalized email prioritization (PEP) has been sparse due to privacy issues, since people are reluctant to share personal messages and importance judgments with the research community. It is therefore important to develop and evaluate PEP methods under the assumption that only limited training examples can be available, and that the system can only have the personal email data of each user during the training and testing of the model for that user. This paper presents the first study (to the best of our knowledge) under such an assumption. Specifically, we focus on analysis of personal social networks to capture user groups and to obtain rich features that represent the social roles from the viewpoint of a particular user. We also developed a novel semi-supervised (transductive) learning algorithm that propagates importance labels from training examples to test examples through message and user nodes in a personal email network. These methods together enable us to obtain an enriched vector representation of each new email message, which consists of both standard features of an email message (such as words in the title or body, sender and receiver IDs, etc.) and the induced social features from the sender and receivers of the message. Using the enriched vector representation as the input in SVM classifiers to predict the importance level for each test message, we obtained significant performance improvement over the baseline system (without induced social features) in our experiments on a multi-user data collection. We obtained significant performance improvement over the baseline system (without induced social features) in our experiments on a multi-user data collection: the relative error reduction in MAE was 31% in micro-averaging, and 14% in macro-averaging.
- Yiming Yang, A. Lad, Henry Shu, B. Kisiel, Chad M. Cumby, R. Ghani, Katharina Probst. 2009. Graph Structure Learning for Task Ordering. Abstract: In many practical applications, multiple interrelated tasks must be accomplished sequentially through user interaction with retrieval, classification and recommendation systems. The ordering of the tasks may have a significant impact on the overall utility (or performance) of the systems; hence optimal ordering of tasks is desirable. However, manual specification of optimal ordering is often difficult when task dependencies are complex, and exhaustive search for the optimal order is computationally intractable when the number of tasks is large. We propose a novel approach to this problem by using a directed graph to represent partialorder preferences among task pairs, and using link analysis (HITS and PageRank) over the graph as a heuristic to order tasks based on how important they are in reinforcing and propagating the ordering preference. These strategies allow us to find near-optimal solutions with efficient computation, scalable to large applications. We conducted a comparative evaluation of the proposed approach on a form-filling application involving a large collection of business proposals from the Accenture Consulting & Technology Company, using SVM classifiers to recommend keywords, collaborators, customers, technical categories and other related fillers for multiple fields in each proposal. With the proposed approach we obtained nearoptimal task orders that improved the utility of the recommendation system by 27% in macro-averaged F1, and 13% in micro-averaged F1, compared to the results obtained using arbitrarily chosen orders, and that were competitive against the best order suggested by domain experts.
- Yiming Yang, J. Carbonell, Monica Rogati. 2009. Domain adaptation of translation models for multilingual applications. Abstract: The performance of a statistical translation algorithm in the context of multilingual applications such as cross-lingual information retrieval (CLIR) and machine translation (MT) depends on the quality, quantity and proper domain matching of the training data. Traditionally, manual selection and customization of training resources has been the prevailing approach. In addition to being labor-intensive, this approach does not scale to the large quantity of heterogeneous resources that have recently become available, such as parallel text and bilingual thesauri in various domains. More importantly, manual customization does not offer a solution to efficiently and effectively producing tailored translation models for a mixture of heterogeneous target documents in various domains, topics, languages and genres. Translation models trained on a general domain do not work well in technical domains; models trained on written documents are not appropriate for spoken dialogue; models trained on manual transcripts can be sub-optimal for translating noisy transcripts produced by a speech recognizer; finally, models trained on a mixture of topics are not optimal for any of the topic-specific documents. 
We seek to address this challenge by automatically adapting translation models (and implicitly parallel training resources) to specific target domains or sub-domains. 
The high-level adaptation process involves automatically weighting and combining multiple translation resources, according to several criteria, in order to better match a target corpus or a specific domain sample. The criteria we examine include lexical-level domain match, translation quality estimates, size, and taxonomy representation. An orthogonal dimension in the adaptation process is the granularity level at which these criteria are measured and applied: from the collection level - under the assumption of homogeneous within-collection data - to the document level. The relative contribution of each criterion is subsequently determined by a model that can range from uniform weighting to a global non-linear optimization model trained on application specific evaluation data. 
In this thesis, we examine how such adaptation applies to two important multilingual applications: cross-lingual information retrieval and machine translation. In CLIR, we adapt translation models for domain-specific query translation; in MT, we adapt translation models to heterogeneous target corpora and compare them with previously studied target language model adaptation. We use our adaptation algorithms to enhance state-of-the-art systems, seeking to improve performance under different testing conditions and to reduce the demand for large amounts of domain specific parallel data. We also address the challenge of combining multiple criteria to rank parallel sentence candidates. We investigate Continuous Reactive Tabu Search (CRTS) [2], a global optimization method, as well as Reactive Affine Shaker (RASH) [6], an efficient algorithm which continuously adjusts its search area in order to identify a local minimum. 
Our experiments in CLIR and statistical MT indicate that selecting training data based on the above-mentioned approaches allows a significant reduction in training data while preserving about 90% of the performance. This result significantly surpasses the random selection approach, and it holds for both CLIR and MT. As expected, the difference increases as the subdomain becomes more specific. Our optimized criteria weights considerably outperform the uniform distribution baseline, as well as lexical similarity adaptation.
- Yiming Yang, Xin Peng, Wenyun Zhao. 2009. Domain Feature Model Recovery from Multiple Applications Using Data Access Semantics and Formal Concept Analysis. Abstract: Feature models are widely employed in domain specific software development to specify the domain requirements with commonality and variability. A feature model is usually constructed by domain experts after comprehensive domain analysis. In this paper, we propose a method to recover an initial domain feature model from multiple existing domain applications using data access semantics and formal concept analysis (FCA). In the method, we first establish mappings among the database schemas of all the reference implementations. Then, we capture the data access semantics of each method in each reference implementation. Based on the pre-established data mapping, we can mix methods from different applications together and conduct formal concept analysis with the data access semantics as intention. After that,further concept merging/pruning and variability analysis are performed to produce the domain feature model. In order to evaluate the effectiveness of our method, we conduct a case study on three open-source forum applications and present comprehensive analysis and discussions on the results.

Abstract: In many practical applications, multiple interrelated tasks must be accomplished sequentially through user interaction. The ordering of the tasks may have a significant impact on the overall utility (or performance) of the systems; hence optimal ordering of tasks is desirable. However, manual specification of optimal ordering is often difficult when task dependencies are complex, and exhaustive search for the optimal order is computationally intractable when the number of tasks is large. We present the first attempt at solving the optimal task ordering problem by learning partial order preferences among tasks based on observed system behavior in context, and by reducing the order optimization problem to a well-known Linear Ordering Problem (LOP). For computational tractability of the LOP solution, we further use link analysis (HITS and PageRank) over a partial-order-preference graph as a heuristic approximation. These strategies allow us to find near-optimal solutions with efficient computation, scalable to large applications. We conducted a comparative evaluation of the proposed approach with two practical applications that involve computer-assisted trouble report generation and IT proposal annotation with heterogeneous classification labels (keywords, collaborators, customers, technical categories, etc.), and obtained highly encouraging results in both applications.

Abstract: The ground resistance, the ground potential rise, touches and step voltages are the basic design quantities of the grounding grids. Such quantities greatly depend on the safety of grounding system. The aim being pursued is to minimize these mentioned quantities, while the safety restrictions required by the standard regulations are met. The innovative aspect of the proposed approach is the influences of reflective coefficient of two-layer soil and the thickness of upper-layer soil, the irregular grounding grid area are analyzed when using this approach for optimum grounding grid design. By discussing the genetic algorithm, architecture of multi-objective optimization design of substation grounding grids, optimal population size and terminal condition, the realization of the proposed strategy is expounded in this paper. Calculation shows that the method is feasible and the optimal results can minimize these mentioned quantities which are not subject to hierarchical structure of soil and irregular grounding area.
- Konstantin Salomatin, Yiming Yang, A. Lad. 2009. Multi-field Correlated Topic Modeling. Abstract: Popular methods for probabilistic topic modeling like the Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA, [1]) and Correlated Topic Models (CTM, [2]) share an important property, i.e., using a common set of topics to model all the data. This property can be too restrictive for modeling complex data entries where multiple fields of heterogeneous data jointly provide rich information about each object or event. We propose a new extension of the CTM method to enable modeling with multi-field topics in a global graphical structure, and a mean-field variational algorithm to allow joint learning of multinomial topic models from discrete data and Gaussianstyle topic models for real-valued data. We conducted experiments with both simulated and real data, and observed that the multi-field CTM outperforms a conventional CTM in both likelihood maximization and perplexity reduction. A deeper analysis on the simulated data reveals that the superior performance is the result of successful discovery of the mapping among field-specific topics and observed data.
- Abhay Harpale, Yiming Yang. 2008. Personalized active learning for collaborative filtering. Abstract: Collaborative Filtering (CF) requires user-rated training examples for statistical inference about the preferences of new users. Active learning strategies identify the most informative set of training examples through minimum interactions with the users. Current active learning approaches in CF make an implicit and unrealistic assumption that a user can provide rating for any queried item. This paper introduces a new approach to the problem which does not make such an assumption. We personalize active learning for the user, and query for only those items which the user can provide rating for. We propose an extended form of Bayesian active learning and use the Aspect Model for CF to illustrate and examine the idea. A comparative evaluation of the new method and a well-established baseline method on benchmark datasets shows statistically significant improvements with our method over the performance of the baseline method that is representative for existing approaches which do not take personalization into account.

Abstract: As disk drives become increasingly sophisticated and processing power increases, one of the most critical issues of designing modern disk systems is data reliability. Although numerous energy saving techniques are available for disk systems, most of energy conservation techniques are not effective in reliability critical environments due to their limitation of ignoring the reliability issue. A wide range of factors affect the reliability of disk systems; the most important factors - disk utilization and ages - are the focus of this study. We build a model to quantify the relationship among the disk age, utilization, and failure probabilities. Observing that the reliability of a disk heavily relies on both disk utilization and age, we propose a novel concept of safe utilization zone, where energy of the disk can be conserved without degrading reliability. We investigate an approach to improving both reliability and energy efficiency of disk systems via utilization control, where disk drives are operated in safe utilization zones to minimize the probability of disk failure. In this study, we integrate an existing energy consumption technique that operates the disks at different power modes with our proposed reliability approach. Experimental results show that our approach can significantly improve reliable while achieving high energy efficiency for disk systems.

Abstract: Automatic subset selection from a parallel corpus significantly cross-lingual information retrieval (CLIR) performance, in addition to increasing its efficiency. Our selection method extracts relevant training data by incorporating additional criteria (i.e. estimated corpus quality, taxonomy projection and size) in addition to lexical-based criteria. The challenge lies in combining these criteria using a meaningful scoring function that can be used for ranking parallel sentence candidates. We choose weighted geometric mean for its soft-AND properties, and we optimize criteria weights by wrapping the CLIR task in an optimization shell. Due to the indeterminate nature of the search space convexity properties, we have explored continuous reactive tabu search (CRTS), a global optimization method. We use a large parallel corpus in the medical domain to examine the effect of adaptation criteria and their combination on CLIR performance. In our experiments, 100 selected sentences yield 90% of the performance obtained with 5,000 times more in-domain parallel sentences. Our optimized criteria weights considerably outperform the uniform distribution baseline, as well as lexical
 similarity adaptation.

Abstract: High performance data grids are increasingly becoming popular platforms to support data-intensive applications. Reducing high energy consumption caused by data grids is a challenging issue. Most previous studies in grid computing focused on performance and reliability without taking energy conservation into account. As such, designing energy-efficient data grid systems became highly desirable. In this paper, we proposed a framework to simulate energy-efficient data grids. We presented an approach to integrate energy-aware allocation strategies into energy-efficient data grids. Our framework aims at simulating a data grid that can conserve energy for data-intensive applications running on data grids.

Abstract: The Mayo Clinic has a long tradition of indexing patient records in high resolution and volume. Several algorithms have been developed which promise to help human coders in the classification process. We evaluate variations on code browsers and free text indexing systems with respect to their speed and error rates in our production environment. The more sophisticated indexing systems save measurable time in the coding process, but suffer from incompleteness which requires a back-up system or human verification. Expert Network does the best job of rank ordering clinical text, potentially enabling the creation of thresholds for the pass through of computer coded data without human review.

Abstract: In a component-based system components are basic computation units implementing specific business functions, and their interactions are explicitly represented by connectors. If the system is required to be adaptable with dynamic architectural evolutions, the connectors must have the capability of being adapted at runtime to different interaction context. Aiming at this requirement, we propose an automatic connector generation method in this paper. In the method, connectors are generated on analysis of behavior and data specifications of two components to be assembled. First a state machine for connector behavior is created, and then the connector can be executed on the state machine, data adaptation scheme and predefined stub templates for various component types. Mismatches on data are resolved by model transformation. An example of payment query in e-business is referred throughout the paper to illustrate our method.

- Yiming Yang, Rong Pan, Sinno Jialin Pan, Qiang Yang, Lei Li. 2007. A Comparative Study on Time Series Classification. Abstract: Time series classification or categorization is an important task in time-series analysis. Unlike traditional methods and problem formulations in time-series analysis, time series classification aims to take whole time sequences as input, and produce discrete labels that are assigned to each sequence. Compared to traditional classification problems, time series classification poses additional difficulties. A major difficulty is due to the fact that the time sequences are variable in length, making many traditional classification methods unable to apply directly. Even for sequences of uniform lengths, many methods can still not be applied directly because often the data located at different parts of the sequences are incomparable. Two methods have been tried separately in the past, including distance based methods such as DTW, and model based methods such as Markov models. Using either of these methods as preprocessing steps, a uniform length vector space can be built to enable the classification methods to be applied. In the past, there has been a lack of comparison between these two methods. This paper compares distance and model based methods on several data sets including synthetic and real data sets, to explicate the relative advantages and disadvantages of these methods. This paper presents several key observations on the relative merits of these two methods, and paves the way for further research in developing new methods for time series classification.
- A. Lad, Yiming Yang. 2007. Generalizing from relevance feedback using named entity wildcards. Abstract: Traditional adaptive filtering systems learn the user's interests in a rather simple way - words from relevant documents are favored in the query model, while words from irrelevant documents are down-weighted. This biases the query model towards specific words seen in the past, causing the system to favor documents containing relevant but redundant information over documents that use previously unseen words to denote new facts about the same news event. This paper proposes news ways of generalizing from relevance feedback by augmenting the traditional bag-of-words query model with named entity wildcards that are anchored in context. The use of wildcards allows generalization beyond specific words, while contextual restrictions limit the wildcard-matching to entities related to the user's query. We test our new approach in a nugget-level adaptive filtering system and evaluate it in terms of both relevance and novelty of the presented information. Our results indicate that higher recall is obtained when lexical terms are generalized using wildcards. However, such wildcards must be anchored to their context to maintain good precision. How the context of a wildcard is represented and matched against a given document also plays a crucial role in the performance of the retrieval system.

Abstract: This paper examines a new approach to information distillation over temporally ordered documents, and proposes a novel evaluation scheme for such a framework. It combines the strengths of and extends beyond conventional adaptive filtering, novelty detection and non-redundant passage ranking with respect to long-lasting information needs ("tasks" with multiple queries). Our approach supports fine-grained user feedback via highlighting of arbitrary spans of text, and leverages such information for utility optimization in adaptive settings. For our experiments, we defined hypothetical tasks based on news events in the TDT4 corpus, with multiple queries per task. Answer keys (nuggets) were generated for each query and a semi-automatic procedure was used for acquiring rules that allow automatically matching nuggets against system responses. We also propose an extension of the NDCG metric for assessing the utility of ranked passages as a combination of relevance and novelty. Our results show encouraging utility enhancements using the new approach, compared to the baseline systems without incremental learning or the novelty detection components.
- Jian Zhang, Zoubin Ghahramani, Yiming Yang. 2005. Learning Multiple Related Tasks using Latent Independent Component Analysis. Abstract: We propose a probabilistic model based on Independent Component Analysis for learning multiple related tasks. In our model the task parameters are assumed to be generated from independent sources which account for the relatedness of the tasks. We use Laplace distributions to model hidden sources which makes it possible to identify the hidden, independent components instead of just modeling correlations. Furthermore, our model enjoys a sparsity property which makes it both parsimonious and robust. We also propose efficient algorithms for both empirical Bayes method and point estimation. Our experimental results on two multi-label text classification data sets show that the proposed approach is promising.
- Fan Li, Yiming Yang. 2005. Analysis of recursive feature elimination methods. Abstract: Recursive feature elimination using SVM (SVM-RFE) has become an effective approach in selecting predictive features. For example, [1] found 8 genes from 7,000 for cancer prediction using SVM-RFE. It is not well understood, however, whether the success of SVM-RFE comes from the recursive process or the choice of the classifier? And, more generally, what property of a classifier would make it successful in RFE? We answer this question by examining multiple classifiers (SVM, ridge regression (RR) and Rocchio) with feature selection in recursive and non-recursive settings, on two DNA microarray datasets and a text categorization benchmark dataset (Reuters-21578).

Abstract: This paper reports a cross-benchmark evaluation of regularized logistic regression (LR) and incremental Rocchio for adaptive filtering. Using four corpora from the Topic Detection and Tracking (TDT) forum and the Text Retrieval Conferences (TREC) we evaluated these methods with non-stationary topics at various granularity levels, and measured performance with different utility settings. We found that LR performs strongly and robustly in optimizing T11SU (a TREC utility function) while Rocchio is better for optimizing Ctrk (the TDT tracking cost), a high-recall oriented objective function. Using systematic cross-corpus parameter optimization with both methods, we obtained the best results ever reported on TDT5, TREC10 and TREC11. Relevance feedback on a small portion (0.05~0.2%) of the TDT5 test documents yielded significant performance improvements, measuring up to a 54% reduction in Ctrk and a 20.9% increase in T11SU (with b=0.1), compared to the results of the top-performing system in TDT2004 without relevance feedback information.
- Fan Li, Yiming Yang. 2005. Using Modified Lasso Regression to Learn Large Undirected Graphs in a Probabilistic Framework. Abstract: Learning the structures of large undirected graphs with thousands of nodes from data has been an open challenge. In this paper, we use graphical Gaussian model (GGM) as the underlying model and propose a novel ARD style Wishart prior for the precision matrix of the GGM. which encodes the graph structure we want to learn. With this prior, we can get the MAP estimation of the precision matrix by solving (a modified version of) Lasso regressions and achieve a sparse solution. We use our approach to learn genetic regulatory networks from genome-wide expression microarray data and protein-binding location analysis data. Evaluated on the basis of consistency with the GO annotations, the experiments show that our approach has a much better performance than the clustering-based approaches and BN learning approaches in discovering gene regulatory modules.
- Fan Li, Yiming Yang. 2005. Using recursive classification to discover predictive features. Abstract: Finding most predictive features for statistical classification is a challenging problem and has important applications. Support Vector Machines (SVMs), for example, have been found successful with a recursive procedure in selecting most important genes for cancer prediction. It is not well understood, however, how much the success depends on the choice of the classifier, and how much on the recursive procedure. We answer this question by examining multiple classifiers (SVM, ridge regression and Rocchio) with feature selection in recursive and non-recursive settings, on a DNA microarray dataset (AMLALL) and a text categorization benchmark (Reuters-21578). We found recursive ridge regression most effective: its best classification performance (zero error) on the AMLALL dataset was obtained when using only 3 genes (selected from over 7000), which is more impressive than the best published result on the same benchmark - zero error of recursive SVM using 8 genes. On Reuters-21578, recursive ridge regression also achieves the best result ever published (the improvement was verified in a significance test). An in-depth analysis of the experimental results shows that the choice of classifier heavily influences the recursive feature selection process: the ridge regression classifier tends to penalize redundant features to a much larger extent than the SVM does.

Its limitation, however, is that it only offers solutions to linear models. Kernel machines with feature scaling techniques have been studied for feature selection with non-linear models. However, such approaches require to solve hard non-convex optimization problems. This paper proposes a new approach named the Feature Vector Machine (FVM). It reformulates the standard Lasso regression into a form isomorphic to SVM, and this form can be easily extended for feature selection with non-linear models by introducing kernels defined on feature vectors. FVM generates sparse solutions in the nonlinear feature space and it is much more tractable compared to feature scaling kernel machines. Our experiments with FVM on simulated data show encouraging results in identifying the small number of dominating features that are non-linearly correlated to the response, a task the standard Lasso fails to complete.
- Fan Li, Yiming Yang. 2005. Analysis of recursive gene selection approaches from microarray data. Abstract: MOTIVATION
Finding a small subset of most predictive genes from microarray for disease prediction is a challenging problem. Support vector machines (SVMs) have been found to be successful with a recursive procedure in selecting important genes for cancer prediction. However, it is not well understood how much of the success depends on the choice of the specific classifier and how much on the recursive procedure. We answer this question by examining multiple classifers [SVM, ridge regression (RR) and Rocchio] with feature selection in recursive and non-recursive settings on three DNA microarray datasets (ALL-AML Leukemia data, Breast Cancer data and GCM data).


RESULTS
We found recursive RR most effective. On the AML-ALL dataset, it achieved zero error rate on the test set using only three genes (selected from over 7000), which is more encouraging than the best published result (zero error rate using 8 genes by recursive SVM). On the Breast Cancer dataset and the two largest categories of the GCM dataset, the results achieved by recursive RR are also very encouraging. A further analysis of the experimental results shows that different classifiers penalize redundant features to different extent and this property plays an important role in the recursive feature selection process. RR classifier tends to penalize redundant features to a much larger extent than the SVM does. This may be the reason why recursive RR has a better performance in selecting genes.

Abstract: Very large-scale classification taxonomies typically have hundreds of thousands of categories, deep hierarchies, and skewed category distribution over documents. However, it is still an open question whether the state-of-the-art technologies in automated text categorization can scale to (and perform well on) such large taxonomies. In this paper, we report the first evaluation of Support Vector Machines (SVMs) in web-page classification over the full taxonomy of the Yahoo! categories. Our accomplishments include: 1) a data analysis on the Yahoo! taxonomy; 2) the development of a scalable system for large-scale text categorization; 3) theoretical analysis and experimental evaluation of SVMs in hierarchical and non-hierarchical settings for classification; 4) an investigation of threshold tuning algorithms with respect to time complexity and their effect on the classification accuracy of SVMs. We found that, in terms of scalability, the hierarchical use of SVMs is efficient enough for very large-scale classification; however, in terms of effectiveness, the performance of SVMs over the Yahoo! Directory is still far from satisfactory, which indicates that more substantial investigation is needed.

Abstract: While automatic classification of email is obviously a useful task to study, it is not obvious how to best utilize the rich metadata specific to email to improve the quality of the classification. In this paper, we propose a simple algorithm for using email threads to improve the precision of a personal email assistant’s automatic folder classification. We evaluate the approach on a large email dataset, and confirm the intuition that email threads can be used for high precision but low recall. Futhermore, we experimentally verify the intuition that using threads is hampered in its improvement of a classifier by the redundancy of their information.
- Yiming Yang, Monica Rogati, B. Kisiel. 2005. Combining Categorization-based and Corpus-based Approaches for CLIR. Abstract: Whether or not we can use existing concept taxonomies to help cross-lingual information retrieval (CLIR) is an open question. This paper investigates an interlingual approach that uses the MeSH categories in the medical domain to index bilingual documents and queries and to measure their relevance based on a category-level matching. We conducted bilingual retrieval experiments on a new corpus (Springer) of medical documents and queries, in the languages of English and German. We also evaluated several high-performing corpus-based learning methods and a machine translation (MT) based approach using SYSTRAN, a commercial system with strong results on CLIR benchmarks. Our results on Springer show that the categorization-based approach significantly outperformed the MT-based approach, but underperformed the corpus-based methods due to the loss of detailed information from the category-level indexing. Combining the output of categorization-based retrieval and corpus-based retrieval yielded a significant performance improvement over using either alone.

Abstract: Taxonomies of the Web typically have hundreds of thousands of categories and skewed category distribution over documents. It is not clear whether existing text classification technologies can perform well on and scale up to such large-scale applications. To understand this, we conducted the evaluation of several representative methods (Support Vector Machines, k-Nearest Neighbor and Naive Bayes) with Yahoo! taxonomies. In particular, we evaluated the effectiveness/efficiency tradeoff in classifiers with hierarchical setting compared to conventional (flat) setting, and tested popular threshold tuning strategies for their scalability and accuracy in large-scale classification problems.
- Bryan Klimt, Yiming Yang. 2004. Introducing the Enron Corpus. Abstract: A large set of email messages, the Enron corpus, was made public during the legal investigation concerning the Enron corporation. This dataset, along with a thorough explanation of its origin, is available at http://www-2.cs.cmu.edu/~enron/. This paper provides a brief introduction and analysis of the dataset. The raw Enron corpus contains 619,446 messages belonging to 158 users. We cleaned the corpus before this analysis by removing certain folders from each user, such as “discussion_threads”. These folders were present for most users, and did not appear to be used directly by the users, but rather were computer generated. Many, such as “all_documents”, also contained large numbers of duplicate emails, which were already present in the users’ other folders. Our goal in this paper is to analyze the suitability of this corpus for exploring how to classify messages as organized by a human, so these folders would have likely been misleading.

Abstract: Information extraction from tables in web pages is a challenging problem due to the diverse nature of table formats and the vocabulary variants in attribute names. This paper presents a new approach to automated table extraction that exploits formatting cues in semi-structured HTML tables, learns lexical variants from training examples and uses a vector space model to deal with non-exact matches among labels. We conducted experiments with this method on a set of tables collected from 157 university web sites, and obtained the information extraction performance of 91.4% in the Fl-measure, showing the effectiveness of the combined use of structural table parsing and example-based label learning.

Abstract: Reuters Corpus Volume I (RCV1) is an archive of over 800,000 manually categorized newswire stories recently made available by Reuters, Ltd. for research purposes. Use of this data for research on text categorization requires a detailed understanding of the real world constraints under which the data was produced. Drawing on interviews with Reuters personnel and access to Reuters documentation, we describe the coding policy and quality control procedures used in producing the RCV1 data, the intended semantics of the hierarchical category taxonomies, and the corrections necessary to remove errorful data. We refer to the original data as RCV1-v1, and the corrected data as RCV1-v2. We benchmark several widely used supervised learning methods on RCV1-v2, illustrating the collection's properties, suggesting new directions for research, and providing baseline results for future studies. We make available detailed, per-category experimental results, as well as corrected versions of the category assignments and taxonomy structures, via online appendices.
- Monica Rogati, Yiming Yang. 2004. Customizing Parallel Corpora at the Document Level. Abstract: Recent research in cross-lingual information retrieval (CLIR) established the need for properly matching the parallel corpus used for query translation to the target corpus. We propose a document-level approach to solving this problem: building a custom-made parallel corpus by automatically assembling it from documents taken from other parallel corpora. Although the general idea can be applied to any application that uses parallel corpora, we present results for CLIR in the medical domain. In order to extract the best-matched documents from several parallel corpora, we propose ranking individual documents by using a length-normalized Okapi-based similarity score between them and the target corpus. This ranking allows us to discard 50-90% of the training data, while avoiding the performance drop caused by a good but mismatched resource, and even improving CLIR effectiveness by 4-7% when compared to using all available training data.

Automated classi(cid:12)cation of email messages into user-speci(cid:12)c folders and information extraction from chronologically ordered email streams have become interesting areas in text learning research. However, the lack of large benchmark collections has been an obstacle for studying the problems and evaluating the solutions. In this paper, we introduce the Enron corpus as a new test bed. We analyze its suitability with respect to email folder prediction, and provide the baseline results of a state-of-the-art classi(cid:12)er (Support Vector Machines) under various conditions, including the cases of using individual sections (From, To, Subject and body) alone as the input to the classi(cid:12)er, and using all the sections in combination with regression weights.

Abstract: In recent years, an increasing number of companies and organizations have put in place geographically distributed teams to carry out development of various products – in particular software products. This trend has economic drivers (globalization, outsourcing) and has been facilitated by the IT revolution (better, cheaper communications). However, it has brought new challenges for the organizations to manage those distributed teams effectively [11].
- Fan Li, Yiming Yang. 2004. Recovering genetic regulatory networks from micro-array data and location analysis data.. Abstract: Learning large network (with hundreds of variables) is gaining interest of many researchers with the emergence of high-throughput biological data sources such as micro-array data. In this paper, we investigated the two popular large scale network structure learning algorithms, sparse candidate hill climbing (SCHC) and Grow-Shrinkage(GS) algorithm. The experiments show that in fact both of them have serious effectiveness problems when the number of variables(genes) is large compared to the number of instances(experimental conditions), which is a common case in micro-array data. We further propose a new large scale structure learning algorithm based on Lasso regression. Theoretical analysis in [10] suggested that the L1-norm in lasso regression could make our algorithm especially suitable in the cases that the number of variables and instances is unbalance. Our algorithm achieves much better results than SCHC and GS on the synthetic data. We also show the effectiveness of our algorithm by learning genetic regulatory network modules from a real micro-array data (with more than 6000 genes), combined with the genome-wide location analysis data. The learned results are consistent well with biological knowledge.
- Monica Rogati, Yiming Yang. 2004. Resource selection for domain-specific cross-lingual IR. Abstract: An under-explored question in cross-language information retrieval (CLIR) is to what degree the performance of CLIR methods depends on the availability of high-quality translation resources for particular domains. To address this issue, we evaluate several competitive CLIR methods - with different training corpora - on test documents in the medical domain. Our results show severe performance degradation when using a general-purpose training corpus or a commercial machine translation system (SYSTRAN), versus a domain-specific training corpus. A related unexplored question is whether we can improve CLIR performance by systematically analyzing training resources and optimally matching them to target collections. We start exploring this problem by suggesting a simple criterion for automatically matching training resources to target corpora. By using cosine similarity between training and target corpora as resource weights we obtained an average of 5.6% improvement over using all resources with no weights. The same metric yields 99.4% of the performance obtained when an oracle chooses the optimal resource every time.
- Jian Zhang, Yiming Yang. 2004. Probabilistic score estimation with piecewise logistic regression. Abstract: Well-calibrated probabilities are necessary in many applications like probabilistic frameworks or cost-sensitive tasks. Based on previous success of asymmetric Laplace method in calibrating text classifiers' scores, we propose to use piecewise logistic regression, which is a simple extension of standard logistic regression, as an alternative method in the discriminative family. We show that both methods have the flexibility to be piecewise linear functions in log-odds, but they are based on quite different assumptions. We evaluated asymmetric Laplace method, piecewise logistic regression and standard logistic regression over standard text categorization collections (Reuters-21578 and TRECAP) with three classifiers (SVM, Naive Bayes and Logistic Regression Classifier), and observed that piecewise logistic regression performs significantly better than the other two methods in the log-loss metric.
- Jian Zhang, Zoubin Ghahramani, Yiming Yang. 2004. A Probabilistic Model for Online Document Clustering with Application to Novelty Detection. Abstract: In this paper we propose a probabilistic model for online document clustering. We use non-parametric Dirichlet process prior to model the growing number of clusters, and use a prior of general English language model as the base distribution to handle the generation of novel clusters. Furthermore, cluster uncertainty is modeled with a Bayesian Dirichlet-multinomial distribution. We use empirical Bayes method to estimate hyperparameters based on a historical dataset. Our probabilistic model is applied to the novelty detection task in Topic Detection and Tracking (TDT) and compared with existing approaches in the literature.
- Yiming Yang, B. Kisiel. 2003. Margin-based local regression for adaptive filtering. Abstract: Adaptive information filtering is an open challenge in information retrieval. One of the tough issues is the optimization of decision thresholds over time, based on partial relevance feedback on the system-retrieved documents in chronological order. We developed a new approach, namely margin-based local regression, that automatically adjusts the thresholds based on a sliding window over the truly positive examples for which the system predicted "yes" with respect to a particular class, and a second sliding window over the other documents being processed by the system. Using the means of the scores of the documents in the two windows, we monitor the temporal drifting of the margin that is a function of both the current classification model and the threshold calibration strategy, and that suggests the bounds for the optimal threshold at a given time. Examining this approach together with a Rocchio-style classifier on the TREC 2001 and TREC 2002 benchmark data sets in adaptive filtering, we obtained significant improvements in performance (measured using Fβ=0.5) over the baseline system that did not adapt the threshold over time, and the best result ever reported on the TREC 2002 benchmark corpus for adaptive filtering evaluations. These empirical results suggest that it is important to use both system-accepted and system-rejected documents to optimize thresholds instead of just using system-accepted documents alone, as well as to make the thresholding function temporally sensitive to the shifting centroids of on-topic and off-topic documents.
- Nianli Ma, Yiming Yang, Monica Rogati. 2003. Cross-Lingual Event Tracking. Abstract: Cross-lingual event tracking from a very large number of information sources (thousands of Web sites, for example) is an open challenge. In this paper we investigate effective and scalable solutions for this problem, focusing on the use of cross-lingual information retrieval techniques to translate a small subset of the training documents, as an alternative to the conventional approach of translating all the multilingual test documents. In addition, we present a new variant of weighted pseudo-relevance feedback for adaptive event tracking. This new method simplifies the assumption and the computation in the best-known approach of this kind, yielding a better result than the latter on benchmark datasets in our evaluations.
- Jian Zhang, Yiming Yang. 2003. Robustness of regularized linear classification methods in text categorization. Abstract: Real-world applications often require the classification of documents under situations of small number of features, mis-labeled documents and rare positive examples. This paper investigates the robustness of three regularized linear classification methods (SVM, ridge regression and logistic regression) under above situations. We compare these methods in terms of their loss functions and score distributions, and establish the connection between their optimization problems and generalization error bounds. Several sets of controlled experiments on the Reuters-21578 corpus are conducted to investigate the robustness of these methods. Our results show that ridge regression seems to be the most promising candidate for rare class problems.
- Yiming Yang, Jian Zhang, B. Kisiel. 2003. A scalability analysis of classifiers in text categorization. Abstract: Real-world applications of text categorization often require a system to deal with tens of thousands of categories defined over a large taxonomy. This paper addresses the problem with respect to a set of popular algorithms in text categorization, including Support Vector Machines, k-nearest neighbor, ridge regression, linear least square fit and logistic regression. By providing a formal analysis of the computational complexity of each classification method, followed by an investigation on the usage of different classifiers in a hierarchical setting of categorization, we show how the scalability of a method depends on the topology of the hierarchy and the category distributions. In addition, we are able to obtain tight bounds for the complexities by using the power law to approximate category distributions over a hierarchy. Experiments with kNN and SVM classifiers on the OHSUMED corpus are reported on, as concrete examples.
- Fan Li, Yiming Yang. 2003. A Loss Function Analysis for Classification Methods in Text Categorization. Abstract: This paper presents a formal analysis of popular text classification methods, focusing on their loss functions whose minimization is essential to the optimization of those methods, and whose decomposition into the training-set loss and the model complexity enables cross-method comparisons on a common basis from an optimization point of view. Those methods include Support Vector Machines, Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, Neural Network, Naive Bayes, K-Nearest Neighbor, Rocchio-style and Multi-class Prototype classifiers. Theoretical analysis (including our new derivations) is provided for each method, along with evaluation results for all the methods on the Reuters-21578 benchmark corpus. Using linear regression, neural networks and logistic regression methods as examples, we show that properly tuning the balance between the training-set loss and the complexity penalty would have a significant impact to the performance of a classifier. In linear regression, in particular, the tuning of the complexity penalty yielded a result (measured using macro-averaged F1) that outperformed all text categorization methods ever evaluated on that benchmark corpus, including Support Vector Machines.

Abstract: This paper presents an unsupervised learning approach to building a non-English (Arabic) stemmer. The stemming model is based on statistical machine translation and it uses an English stemmer and a small (10 K sentences) parallel corpus as its sole training resources. No parallel text is needed after the training phase. Monolingual, unannotated text can be used to further improve the stemmer by allowing it to adapt to a desired domain or genre. Examples and results will be given for Arabic, but the approach is applicable to any language that needs affix removal. Our resource-frugal approach results in 87.5% agreement with a state of the art, proprietary Arabic stemmer built using rules, affix lists, and human annotated text, in addition to an unsupervised component. Task-based evaluation using Arabic information retrieval indicates an improvement of 22-38% in average precision over unstemmed text, and 96% of the performance of the proprietary stemmer above.

Abstract: Logistic Regression (LR) has been widely used in statistics for many years, and has received extensive study in machine learning community recently due to its close relations to Support Vector Machines (SVM) and AdaBoost. In this paper, we use a modified version of LR to approximate the optimization of SVM by a sequence of unconstrained optimization problems. We prove that our approximation will converge to SVM, and propose an iterative algorithm called "MLR-CG" which uses Conjugate Gradient as its inner loop. Multiclass version "MMLR-CG" is also obtained after simple modifications. We compare the MLR-CG with SVMlight over different text categorization collections, and show that our algorithm is much more efficient than SVMlight when the number of training examples is very large. Results of the multiclass version MMLR-CG is also reported.

We participated in two bilingual runs and the small multilingual run using software and data that are free to obtain, transparent and modifiable.

Abstract: Automated detection of the first document reporting each new event in temporally-sequenced streams of documents is an open challenge. In this paper we propose a new approach which addresses this problem in two stages: 1) using a supervised learning algorithm to classify the on-line document stream into pre-defined broad topic categories, and 2) performing topic-conditioned novelty detection for documents in each topic. We also focus on exploiting named-entities for event-level novelty detection and using feature-based heuristics derived from the topic histories. Evaluating these methods using a set of broadcast news stories, our results show substantial performance gains over the traditional one-level approach to the novelty detection problem.

The MT-based approach was most effective among these alternatives in our experiments for English-Chinese retrieval on the NTCIR-2 and 3 data. Combined use of machine translation and thesaurus extraction yielded further improvement.

Abstract: This paper studies the effects of boosting in the context of different classification methods for text categorization, including Decision Trees, Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machines (SVMs) and a Rocchio-style classifier. We identify the inductive biases of each classifier and explore how boosting, as an error-driven resampling mechanism, reacts to those biases. Our experiments on the Reuters-21578 benchmark show that boosting is not effective in improving the performance of the base classifiers on common categories. However, the effect of boosting for rare categories varies across classifiers: for SVMs and Decision Trees, we achieved a 13-17% performance improvement in macro-averaged F1 measure, but did not obtain substantial improvement for the other two classifiers. This interesting finding of boosting on rare categories has not been reported before.
- J. Kubica, A. Moore, J. Schneider, Yiming Yang. 2002. Stochastic link and group detection. Abstract: Link detection and analysis has long been important in the social sciences and in the government intelligence community. A significant effort is focused on the structural and functional analysis of "known" networks. Similarly, the detection of individual links is important but is usually done with techniques that result in "known" links. More recently the internet and other sources have led to a flood of circumstantial data that provide probabilistic evidence of links. Co-occurrence in news articles and simultaneous travel to the same location are two examples.We propose a probabilistic model of link generation based on membership in groups. The model considers both observed link evidence and demographic information about the entities. The parameters of the model are learned via a maximum likelihood search. In this paper we describe the model and then show several heuristics that make the search tractable. We test our model and optimization methods on synthetic data sets with a known ground truth and a database of news articles.
- Yiming Yang. 2002. Relevance of Cluster size in MMR based Summarizer : A Report. Abstract: ion of documents by humans is complex to model as is any other information processing by humans. The abstracts differ from person to person, and usually vary in the style, language and detail. The process of abstraction is complex to be formulated mathematically or logically [14]. In the last decade some systems have been developed that generate abstractions using the latest natural language processing tools. These systems extract phrases and lexical chains from the documents and fuse them together with generative tools to produce a summary (or abstraction). A comparatively less complex approach is to make an extractive summary in which sentences from the original documents are selected and presented together as a summary. PROBLEMS WITH EXTRACTIVE METHODS: • Extracted sentences usually tend to be longer than average. Due to this, part of the segments that are not essential for summary also get included, consuming space. • Important or relevant information is usually spread across sentences, and extractive summaries cannot capture this (unless the summary is long enough to hold all those sentences). • Conflicting information may not be presented accurately. PROBLEMS WITH ABSTRACTIVE METHODS: • It has been shown that users prefer extractive summaries instead of glossed-over abstractive summaries [15]. This is because extractive summaries present the information as-is by the author, and would allow the users to read between-thelines information. • Sentence synthesis is not a well-developed field yet, and hence the machine generated automatic summaries would result in incoherence even within a sentence. In case of extractive summaries, incoherence occurs only at the border of two sentences. The work presented in this report is relevant to extractive summaries. In the rest of this section we study some specific methods producing extractive summaries. 6.1 EXTRACTIVE METHODS Extractive summarizers aim at picking out the most relevant sentences in the document while also maintaining a low redundancy in the summary. While anti-redundancy was not explicitly documented in older systems, most of the current systems account for it in their own novel ways. 6.1.1 CLASSICAL METHOD: Though text summarization has drawn attention primarily after the information explosion on the Internet, the seminal work has been done as early as in the 1950’s. Edmundson presents a survey of the then existing methods to automatic summarization in [16] and a Design Scoring schemes for sentences Extract top scoring sentences to form summary Compare summary with manually extracted summary from A Figure 2: Step 2 in of the summarization process elicited by Edmondson: Design sentence scoring metrics such that extracted sentences are close to manually generated summaries of Step 1. Iteratively improve scoring schemes. systematic approach to summarization which forms the core of the extraction methods even today in [7]. Edmundson’s approach is summarized in Figure 2. The key ideas in this approach are: 1. Study human generated abstracts, and specify characteristics expected in automatically generated abstracts 2. Generate such abstracts manually. 3. Design mathematical and logical formulations to score and pick out sentences from the documents to match these manually generated abstracts. A system of recent times, that automatically learns from training documents and their corresponding abstracts is described in [17]. 4. Iteratively improve the sentence-scoring scheme to match the automatic abstracts to manually generated abstracts. Computationally representable features of sentences that are useful to score sentences for potential inclusion in the summaries have been proposed in [7], and are used even in the systems of today. Stop words are removed. Sentences are then scored according to four factors: Cue: Those containing cue words/phrases like conclusion, according to the study, hardly are given a higher weight than those not containing them.

- Monica Rogati, Yiming Yang. 2002. High-performing feature selection for text classification. Abstract: This paper reports a controlled study on a large number of filter feature selection methods for text classification. Over 100 variants of five major feature selection criteria were examined using four well-known classification algorithms: a Naive Bayesian (NB) approach, a Rocchio-style classifier, a k-nearest neighbor (kNN) method and a Support Vector Machine (SVM) system. Two benchmark collections were chosen as the testbeds: Reuters-21578 and small portion of Reuters Corpus Version 1 (RCV1), making the new results comparable to published results. We found that feature selection methods based on chi2 statistics consistently outperformed those based on other criteria (including information gain) for all four classifiers and both data collections, and that a further increase in performance was obtained by combining uncorrelated and high-performing feature selection methods.The results we obtained using only 3% of the available features are among the best reported, including results obtained with the full feature set.
- Yiming Yang. 2002. {25 () a Study of Approaches to Hypertext Categorization. Abstract: Hypertext poses new research challenges for text classiication. Hyperlinks, HTML tags, category labels distributed over linked documents, and meta data extracted from related web sites all provide rich information for classifying hypertext documents. How to appropriately represent that information and automatically learn statistical patterns for solving hypertext classiication problems is an open question. This paper seeks a principled approach to providing the answers. Speciically, we deene ve hypertext regularities which may (or may not) hold in a particular application domain, and whose presence (or absence) may signiicantly innuence the optimal design of a classiier. Using three hypertext datasets and three well-known learning algorithms (Naive Bayes, Nearest Neighbor, and First Order Inductive Learner), we examine these regularities in diierent domains, and compare alternative ways to exploit them. Our experimental results suggest that a naive use of linked pages, such as treating the words in the linked neighborhood of a page as local to that page, can be more harmful than helpful when the linked neighborhood is highly \noisy". This is especially true if the classiier is not suuciently robust in discriminating informative words from noisy ones. It is also evident in our results that extracting meta data (when available) from related web sites can be extremely useful for improving classiication accuracy. Finally, the relative performance of the classiiers being tested provides insights into their strengths and limitations for solving classiication problems involving diverse and often noisy web pages.
- Yiming Yang. 2001. A study of thresholding strategies for text categorization. Abstract: Thresholding strategies in automated text categorization are an underexplored area of research. This paper presents an examination of the effect of thresholding strategies on the performance of a classifier under various conditions. Using k-Nearest Neighbor (kNN) as the classifier and five evaluation benchmark collections as the testbets, three common thresholding methods were investigated, including rank-based thresholding (RCut), proportion-based assignments (PCut) and score-based local optimization (SCut); in addition, new variants of these methods are proposed to overcome significant problems in the existing approaches. Experimental results show that the choice of thresholding strategy can significantly influence the performance of kNN, and that the ``optimal'' strategy may vary by application. SCut is potentially better for fine-tuning but risks overfitting. PCut copes better with rare categories and exhibits a smoother trade-off in recall versus precision, but is not suitable for online decision making. RCut is most natural for online response but is too coarse-grained for global or local optimization. RTCut, a new method combining the strength of category ranking and scoring, outperforms both PCut and RCut significantly.

We focused on the effects of extracting a comparable corpus from the given newspaper data; our corpus doubled the average precision when used together with the provided parallel corpus. The PRF performance was lower for the queries with few relevant documents. We also examined the effects of the PRF first-step retrieval in the source language half of the parallel corpus vs. the entire document collection .

Abstract: 1 Overview The Informedia-II Project will change the paradigm for accessing digital video libraries through meaningful, manipulable overviews of video document sets, multimodal queries, and adaptive summarizations of very large amounts of video from heterogeneous distributed sources. Video information collages are the key technology in Informedia-II and will be built by advancing information visualization research to effectively deal with multiple video documents. A video information collage is a presentation of text, images, audio, and video derived from multiple video sources in order to summarize, provide context, and communicate aspects of the content for the originating set of sources. The collages to be investigated include chrono-collages emphasizing time, geo-collages emphasizing spatial relationships, and auto-documentaries which preserve video's temporal nature. Users will be able to interact with the video collages to generate multimodal queries across time, space, and sources. Video collages are made adaptive by giving preference to the concepts and query terms in the user's interaction history. The synthesis and summarization functions underlying these collages will be made possible through extensions of text clustering and expectation maximization algorithms to video and audio features. 2.1 Video Information Collages: Adaptive Visualization and Summarization 2.1.1 Interactive visualization of digital library data and metadata Much current research on digital libraries focuses on named entity extraction and transformation into structured metadata. Examples include entities like events, people, and places, and attributes like birth date or latitude. Unfortunately, this extraction process is not very reliable, and in any case a digital library may contain references to hundreds of thousands of entities. We have been integrating Visage and Visage functionality for visualization and semantic zooming within the Informedia library. Information visualization is a powerful tool for summarizing large sets of structured data about entities and their relationships to uncover overall patterns, and then drilling down into interesting subsets. We have applied this technique to metadata extracted from the Informedia Digital Video Library, and demonstrated examples of conclusions that can be drawn from metadata patterns alone at JCDL'01. Currently, text attributes are handled poorly in terms of both query semantics and interaction speed. Our goal is to overcome these difficulties, so that integrated data and metadata library browsing becomes a continuous interactive activity. The visual query language allows database-style joins between entities of different types, Dynamic Query filtering of attribute values, visualization of conditional attribute value distributions with histograms, and drill down to individual entities [Derthick1997]. For instance, the …
- R. Ghani, Seán Slattery, Yiming Yang. 2001. Hypertext Categorization using Hyperlink Patterns and Meta Data. Abstract: Hypertext poses new text classi cation research challenges as hyperlinks, content of linked documents, and meta data about related web sites all provide richer sources of information for hypertext classi cation that are not available in traditional text classi cation. We investigate the use of such information for representing web sites, and the e ectiveness of di erent classi ers (Naive Bayes, Nearest Neighbor, and Foil) in exploiting those representations. We nd that using words in web pages alone often yields suboptimal performance of classi ers, compared to exploiting additional sources of information beyond document content. On the other hand, we also observe that linked pages can be more harmful than helpful when the linked neighborhoods are highly \noisy" and that links have to be used in a careful manner. More importantly, our investigation suggests that meta data which is often available, or can be acquired using Information Extraction techniques, can be extremely useful for improving classi cation accuracy. Finally, the relative performance of the di erent classi ers being tested gives us insights into the strengths and limitations of our algorithms for hypertext classi cation.
- Tom Ault, Yiming Yang. 2001. kNN, Rocchio and Metrics for Information Filtering at TREC-10. Abstract: We compared a multi-class k-nearest neighbor (kNN) approach and a standard Rocchio method in the filtering tasks of TREC-10. Empirically, we found kNN more effective in batch filtering, and Rocchio better in adaptive filtering. For threshold adjustment based on relevance feedback, we developed a new strategy that updates a local regression over time based on a sliding window over positive examples and a sliding window over negative examples in the history. Applying this strategy to Rocchio and comparing its results to those by the same method with a fixed threshold, the recall was improved by 37-39% while the precision was improved by as much as 9%. Motivated by the extremely low performance of all systems on the T10S metric, we also analyzed this metric, and found that it favors more frequently occurring categories over rare ones and is somewhat inconsistent with its most straightforward interpretation. We propose a change to this metric which fixes these problems and brings it closer to the C trk metric used to evaluate the TDT tracking task.
- Yiming Yang, Tom Ault, Thomas Pierce. 2000. Combining Multiple Learning Strategies for Effective Cross Validation. Abstract: Parameter tuning through cross-validation becomes very diicult when the validation set contains no or only a few examples of the classes in the evaluation set. We address this open challenge by using a combination of classiiers with diierent performance characteristics to eeectively reduce the performance variance on average of the overall system across all classes, including those not seen before. This approach allows us to tune the combination system on available but less-representative validation data and obtain smaller performance degradation of this system on the evaluation data than using a single-method classiier alone. We tested this approach by applying k-Nearest Neighbor, Rocchio and Language Modeling classiiers and their combination to the event tracking problem in the Topic Detection and Tracking (TDT) domain, where new classes (events) are created constantly over time, and representative validation sets for new classes are often diicult to obtain on time. When parameters tuned on an early benchmark TDT corpus were evaluated on a later TDT benchmark corpus with no overlapping events, we observed a 38-65% reduction in tracking cost (a weighted combination of errors) by the combined system over the individual methods evaluated under the same conditions, strongly suggesting the robustness of this approach as a solution for improving cross-class performance consistency of statistical classi-ers when standard cross-validation fails due to the lack of representative validation sets.
- Yiming Yang, Tom Ault, Thomas Pierce, Charles W. Lattimer. 2000. Improving text categorization methods for event tracking. Abstract: Automated tracking of events from chronologically ordered document streams is a new challenge for statistical text classification. Existing learning techniques must be adapted or improved in order to effectively handle difficult situations where the number of positive training instances per event is extremely small, the majority of training documents are unlabelled, and most of the events have a short duration in time. We adapted several supervised text categorization methods, specifically several new variants of the k-Nearest Neighbor (kNN) algorithm and a Rocchio approach, to track events. All of these methods showed significant improvement (up to 71% reduction in weighted error rates) over the performance of the original kNN algorithm on TDT benchmark collections, making kNN among the top-performing systems in the recent TDT3 official evaluation. Furthermore, by combining these methods, we significantly reduced the variance in performance of our event tracking system over different data collections, suggesting a robust solution for parameter optimization.
- Tom Ault, Yiming Yang. 2000. kNN at TREC-9. Abstract: We applied a multi-class k-nearest-neighbor based text classiication algorithm to the adap-tive and batch ltering problems in the TREC-9 ltering track. While our systems performed well in the batch ltering tasks, they did not perform as well in the adaptive ltering tasks, in part because we did not have an adequate mechanism for taking advantage of the relevance feedback information provided by the l-tering tasks. Since TREC-9, we have made considerable improvements in our batch ltering results and discovered some serious problems with both the T9P and T9U metrics. In this paper, we discuss these issues and their impact on our ltering results.

Abstract: This paper studies the eeective use of information retrieval and machine learning techniques in a new task, event detection and tracking. The objective is to automatically detect novel events from chronologically-ordered streams of news stories, and track events of interest over time. We extended existing supervised learning and unsupervised clustering algorithms to allow document classiication based on both information content and temporal aspects of events. A task-oriented evaluation was conducted using Reuters and CNN news stories. We found agglomerative document clustering highly eeective (82% in the F 1 measure) for retrospective event detection, and single-pass clustering with time windowing a better choice for on-line alerting of novel events. We also observed robust learning behavior for k-nearest neighbor (kNN) classiication and a decision-tree approach in event tracking, under the diicult condition when the number of positive training examples is extremely small.

Abstract: This paper reports a controlled study with statistical signi cance tests on ve text categorization methods: the Support Vector Machines (SVM), a k-Nearest Neighbor (kNN) classi er, a neural network (NNet) approach, the Linear Leastsquares Fit (LLSF) mapping and a Naive Bayes (NB) classier. We focus on the robustness of these methods in dealing with a skewed category distribution, and their performance as function of the training-set category frequency. Our results show that SVM, kNN and LLSF signi cantly outperform NNet and NB when the number of positive training instances per category are small (less than ten), and that all the methods perform comparably when the categories are su ciently common (over 300 instances).
- Vibhu Mittal, Yiming Yang, Jan O. Pedersen. 1999. Automatic Text Summarization of Multiple Documents Thesis Proposal Thesis Committee. Abstract: In this era, where electronic text information is exponentially growing and where time is a critical resource, it has become virtually impossible for any user to browse or read large numbers of individual documents. It is therefore important to explore methods of allowing users to locate and browse information quickly within collections of documents. Automatic text summarization of multiple documents fulllls such information seeking goals by providing a method for the user to quickly view highlights and/or relevant portions of document collections. As of yet, there has been little work with multi-document summarization, although single document summarization has been a subject of focus in the last few years. Multi-document summarization diiers from single in that the issues of compression, speed, redundancy and passage selection are critical in the formation of useful summaries. If multi-document summarization is to be useful across subject areas and languages, it must be relatively independent of natural language understanding. A statistical approach allows for both rapid passage selection and speed. The maximal marginal relevance (MMR) metric is used to provide \relevant" novelty in passage selection, i.e., selecting passages that meet the criteria of relevance to a query, while reducing redundancy and maximizing diversity among the individual passages. The approach builds on previous work in single-document summarization by using additional , available information about the document set as a whole, the relationships between the documents, as well as properties of individual documents. The underlying framework is modular , thus allowing easy parameterization to take into account diierent document genres or corpora characteristics, user requirements, as well as linguistic properties of languages that can enhance summarization results. The principal question being addressed is "Can multi-document summarization effectively indicate the textual content of document collections and assist users to rapidly nd their desired information?" I will explore this question by evaluating the system in the domains of newswire articles, web pages, and time permitting, computer science technical reports.
- Yiming Yang, Jan O. Pedersen. 1999. Intelligent information retrieval. Abstract: In this paper an intelligent agent-based model for information retrieval is presented. The growing amount of online information and its dynamic nature forces us to reconsider existing passive approaches for information retrieval. Because of this ever-growing size of information sources the burden of retrieving information cannot be simply left on users. Our approach uses agent-based paradigm in order to handle this problem. Further in order to avoid users being overloaded with bulk of irrelevant information along with relevant ones and to improve ranking of the returned documents, we attempt to include semantics in making relevance judgment through conceptual graphs. We have first applied vector space model and then used conceptual graph to obtain final ranking. The results achieved show improved ranking of the returned documents.

Abstract: Topic Detection and Tracking (TDT) is a DARPA-sponsored initiative to investigate the state of the art in finding and following new events in a stream of broadcast news stories. The TDT problem consists of three major tasks: (1) segmenting a stream of data, especially recognized speech, into distinct stories; (2) identifying those news stories that are the first to discuss a new event occurring in the news; and (3) given a small number of sample news stories about an event, finding all following stories in the stream.
- Yiming Yang, Thomas Pierce, J. Carbonell. 1998. A study of retrospective and on-line event detection. Abstract: This paper investigates the use and extension
of text retrieval and clustering techniques for event
detection. The task is to automatically detect novel
events from a temporally-ordered stream of news stories,
either retrospectively or as the stories arrive. We applied
hierarchical and non-hierarchical document clustering algorithms
to a corpus of 15,836 stories, focusing on the
exploitation of both content and temporal information.
We found the resulting cluster hierarchies highly informative
for retrospective detection of previously unidentified
events, effectively supporting both query-free and
query-driven retrieval. We also found that temporal distribution
patterns of document clusters provide useful
information for improvement in both retrospective detection
and on-line detection of novel events. In an
evaluation using manually labelled events to judge the
system-detected events, we obtained a result of 82% in
the Fl measure for retrospective detection, and a Fl
value of 42% for on-line detection.
- T. Martonen, Yiming Yang, M. Dolovich, X. Guan. 1997. Computer simulations of lung morphologies within planar gamma camera images. Abstract: A mathematical model and computer code have been developed to unambiguously interpret planar gamma camera images. Specifically, the algorithm permits airway composition of the central, intermediate and peripheral partitions of scans to be determined quantitatively. The algorithm unambigously identifies the spatial coordinates of each of the millions of airways within the adult human lung, and assigns every individual airway to a precise location within the gamma camera image format prescribed by the clinician. This is done on a patient-by-patient basis. The algorithm has evolved from clinical applications of the previous work of Martonen et al. [1]. The objective of the current work was to advance the original protocol and derive an algorithm that was: (1) from a medical perspective, more physiologically realistic; and (2) from a technical perspective, easier to apply in the medical arena. Regarding (1), the major elements of the algorithm are that the outer boundary of the lung is formulated directly from lung perfusion imaging data and that the lung is divided into distinct left and right components. Regarding (2), the algorithm has been written for use with common workstations. It is our hope that the improvements will facilitate applications of the new model-code into aerosol therapy regimens.

- Yiming Yang, Jan O. Pedersen. 1997. A Comparative Study on Feature Selection in Text Categorization. Abstract: This paper is a comparative study of feature selection methods in statistical learning of text categorization. The focus is on aggressive dimensionality reduction. Five meth-ods were evaluated, including term selection based on document frequency (DF), information gain (IG), mutual information (MI), a (cid:31) 2 -test (CHI), and term strength (TS). We found IG and CHI most e(cid:11)ective in our experiments. Using IG thresholding with a k-nearest neighbor classi(cid:12)er on the Reuters corpus, removal of up to 98% removal of unique terms actually yielded an improved classi(cid:12)-cation accuracy (measured by average precision). DF thresholding performed similarly. Indeed we found strong correlations between the DF, IG and CHI values of a term. This suggests that DF thresholding, the simplest method with the lowest cost in computation, can be reliably used instead of IG or CHI when the computation of these measures are too expensive. TS compares favorably with the other methods with up to 50% vocabulary reduction but is not competitive at higher vocabulary reduction levels. In contrast, MI had relatively poor performance due to its bias towards favoring rare terms, and its sensitivity to probability estimation errors.
- Yiming Yang, W. Wilbur. 1996. Using Corpus Statistics to Remove Redundant Words in Text Categorization. Abstract: This article studies aggressive word removal in text categorization to reduce the noise in free texts and to enhance the computational efficiency of categorization. We use a novel stop word identification method to automatically generate domain specific stoplists which are much larger than a conventional domain-independent stoplist. In our tests with three categorization methods on text collections from different domains/applications, significant numbers of words were removed without sacrificing categorization effectiveness. In the test of the Expert Network method on CACM documents, for example, an 87% removal of unique words reduced the vocabulary of documents from 8,002 distinct words to 1,045 words, which resulted in a 63% time savings and a 74% memory savings in the computation of category ranking, with a 10% precision improvement on average over not using word removal. It is evident in this study that automated word removal based on corpus statistics has a practical and significant impact on the computational tractability of categorization methods in large databases.

Abstract: Whether or not high accuracy classification methods can be scaled to large applications is crucial for the ultimate usefulness of such methods in text categorization. This paper applies two statistical learning algorithms, the Linear Least Squares Fit (LLSF) mapping and a Nearest Neighbor classifier named ExpNet, to a large collection of MEDLINE documents. With the use of suitable dimensionality reduction techniques and efficient algorithms, both LLSF and ExpNet successfully scaled to this very large problem with a result significantly outperforming word-matching and other automatic learning methods applied to the same corpus.

Abstract: This paper studies noise reduction for computational efficiency improvements in a statistical learning method for text categorization, the Linear Least Squares Fit (LLSF) mapping. Multiple noise reduction strategies are proposedand evaluated, including: an aggressive removal of “non-informative words” from texts before training; the use of a truncated singular value decomposition to cut off noisy “latent semantic structures” during training; the elimination of non-influential components in the LLSF solution (a word-concept association matrix) after training. Text collections in different domains were used for evaluation. Significant improvements in computational efficiency without losing categorization accuracy were evident in the testing results.
- T. Martonen, Yiming Yang, D. Hwang, J. Fleming. 1994. Mapping the human lung using Delaunay tessellation.. Abstract: A computer protocol is (1) developed and (2) applied to the human body for medical research. Delaunay tessellation is used to derive an algorithm to describe the structure of the lung. This may be the first application of that mathematical concept to a physiological system. The lung is a complex yet systematic network of pathways described herein with cited dimensions and angles. Its terminal points are the most distal airways, alveolar sacs, defined by their (x, y, z) coordinates. We have addressed that spatial array as a set of points in 3-D space, and, visualized the physical boundary of a lung as the surface of the convex hull of that set in R3. As documented, the enveloping surface of the computer lung closely describes the outer contours of human lungs depicted in clinical studies. Therefore, the model has immediate and salient implications to problems in medicine where respiratory function and morphology have integral roles, specifically, thoracic surgery and aerosol therapy. Examples include the removal of lobes damaged by respiratory diseases such as cystic fibrosis and cancer, and the definition of lung boundaries for gamma camera, PET, and SPECT images. Importantly, the model can be varied to simulate the intersubject differences that physicians experience among a patient population. The mathematical simulations performed in this work are intended to be complementary to laboratory investigations in the medical arena. By providing accurate 3-D, quantitative descriptions of human lungs the supercomputer can be actively integrated into the clinical environment.
- T. Martonen, Yiming Yang, M. Dolovich. 1994. Definition of Airway Composition Within Gamma Camera Images. Abstract: The efficacies of inhaled pharmacologic drugs in the prophylaxis and treatment of airway diseases could be improved if particles were selectively directed to appropriate sites. In the medical arena, planar gamma scintillation cameras may be employed to study factors affecting such particle deposition patterns within the lung. The value and versatility of such instruments, however, are compromised by the limited resolution of their images. Specifically, it is not possible to determine the composition of their central (C) or large airway, intermediate (I), and peripheral (P) or small airway zones. We present an analytical model to assist the clinician in the systematic analysis and interpretation of gamma camera images. Using the Cray Y-MP supercomputer, a range of human lung morphologies has been mapped to function as templates that can be superimposed on scans. The model is intended to complement laboratory regimens by providing a previously unavailable method to define the C, I, and P zones of the human lung generation by generation. A quantitative value now can be assigned to the degree of overlapping that exists in the images. For example, for a “typical” lung morphology consisting of 16,777,215 airways (total), the C zone itself may contain 1,608,246 airways, of which 1,595,940, or 99.2%, are alveolated airways. By identifying composition, our intent is to integrate the model into future aerosol therapy protocols and thereby assist procedures that target delivery of airborne pharmaceuticals.
- Yiming Yang, C. Chute, G. E. Atkin, Andrew A. Anda. 1994. TREC-3 Retrieval Evaluation Using Expert Network. Abstract: In Mayo Clinic's first year of participation at the Text Retrieval Conference (TREC-3, Category B), our system takes a completely automatic approach to both routing and ad-hoc retrieval, using a combination of a statistical learner (Expert Network or ExpNet) and a shared-word-based matcher (STR). Our focus is to examine how much a Nearest Neighbor approach to query expansion can improve retrieval performance, given the kind of relevance information available in TREC. We found ExpNet effective in the routing test because large amounts of relevant documents are available for each query. In contrast, we found ExpNet often not representative of the testing queries. Therefore, relevance information about such training queries is not very useful for statistical learning about query expansion in general. A realistic strategy for the TREC collections then is to use shared-word-based matching as a basic approach to relevance judgment, and use statistical learning about human judgements for additional evidence. Our experiments show that combining ExpNet and STR leads to better results than using either alone.
- Yiming Yang, C. Chute. 1994. An example-based mapping method for text categorization and retrieval. Abstract: A unified model for text categorization and text retrieval is introduced. We use a training set of manually categorized documents to learn word-category associations, and use these associations to predict the categories of arbitrary documents. Similarly, we use a training set of queries and their related documents to obtain empirical associations between query words and indexing terms of documents, and use these associations to predict the related documents of arbitrary queries. A Linear Least Squares Fit (LLSF) technique is employed to estimate the likelihood of these associations. Document collections from the MEDLINE database and Mayo patient records are used for studies on the effectiveness of our approach, and on how much the effectiveness depends on the choices of training data, indexing language, word-weighting scheme, and morphological canonicalization. Alternative methods are also tested on these data collections for comparison. It is evident that the LLSF approach uses the relevance information effectively within human decisions of categorization and retrieval, and achieves a semantic mapping of free texts to their representations in an indexing language. Such a semantic mapping lead to a significant improvement in categorization and retrieval, compared to alternative approaches.
- Yiming Yang, C. Chute. 1993. An application of least squares fit mapping to text information retrieval. Abstract: This paper describes a unique example-based mapping method for document retrieval. We discovered that the knowledge about relevance among queries and documents can be used to obtain empirical connections between query terms and the canonical concepts which are used for indexing the content of documents. These connections do not depend on whether there are shared terms among the queries and documents; therefore, they are especially effective for a mapping from queries to the documents where the concepts are relevant but the terms used by article authors happen to be different from the terms of database users. We employ a Linear Least Squares Fit (LLSF) technique to compute such connections from a collection of queries and documents where the relevance is assigned by humans, and then use these connections in the retrieval of documents where the relevance is unknown. We tested this method on both retrieval and indexing with a set of MEDLINE documents which has been used by other information retrieval systems for evaluations. The effectiveness of the LLSF mapping and the significant improvement over alternative approaches was evident in the tests.
- Yiming Yang, C. Chute. 1992. A Linear Least Squares Fit Mapping Method for Information Retrieval From Natural Language Texts. Abstract: This paper describes a unique method for mapping natural language texts to canonical terms that identify the contents of the texts. This method learns empirical associations between free-form texts and canonical terms from human-assigned matches and determines a Linear Least Squares Fit (LLSF) mapping function which represents weighted connections between words in the texts and the canonical terms. The mapping function enables us to project an arbitrary text to the canonical term space where the "transformed" text is compared with the terms, and similarity scores are obtained which quantify the relevance between the the text and the terms. This approach has superior power to discover synonyms or related terms and to preserve the context sensitivity of the mapping. We achieved a rate of 84% in both the recall and the precision with a testing set of 6,913 texts, outperforming other techniques including string matching (15%), morphological parsing (17%) and statistical weighting (21%).

Abstract: The many existing hierarchical classifications present opportunities for computer-aided classification of medical data. The authors evaluate lexical term mapping followed by hierarchical node activation to determine the semantic locality of diagnoses in the American College of Radiology (ACR) classification. The activated hierarchy exposes conceptual structures behind lexically matched categories and markedly narrows the alternatives for human review. Several distribution analyses are evaluated for narrowing the candidate search space, to reduce ambiguity. The methods were tested on a prototype system, using a set of 78 samples of Mayo radiology diagnoses; their relative effectiveness is illustrated.

Abstract: The UMLS project seeks to provide a unified interface to biomedical knowledge resources. Patient medical records are an enormous repository of clinical intervention and outcome, and are drawing increasing attention in the pursuit of quality assurance, outcomes research, and epidemiologic analysis. We sought to evaluate an unedited version of the preliminary UMLS Metathesaurus, Meta-1, for the automated coding of medical diagnosis and surgical procedures. Identical evaluations were undertaken using SNOMED and the Mayo Clinic indexing lexicon. Meta-1 performed comparably to the comparison clinical indexing systems, although all systems exhibited problems associated with clinical attribute levels and modifier combinations.
- Yiming Yang. 1987. Combining Prediction, Syntactic Analysis and Semantic Analysis in Chinese Sentence Analysis. Abstract: This paper describes a system for the analysis of Chinese language that incorporates several heuristic techniques for reducing ambiguities. 
 
Heuristic knowledge about "characteristic" words is used to predict a partial syntactic structure of sentence before doing global analysis. More than one prediction may exist, the system chooses the best combination of compatible partial predictions. Backtracking is evoked if acontradiction is later detected, producing a different choice of predictions. 
 
Semantic constraints are used for translating phrase structure into case structure Rules are written to independent modules for word classes. An object-oriented scheme organizes the rules into layers, according to their priorities of application. 
 
A preference score is calculated at each step of processing, giving a synthetic evaluation of both syntactic plausibility and semantic plausibility. The scores of partial results steer a priority-driven parser towards the most plausible sentence structure, instead of generating all the possible results and afterwards making the choice. 
 
An experimental system based on these techniques has been built and tested on over one hundred sentences selected from published material. The results were very successful. The number of trees required to be produced in order to obtain a correct analysis was typically reduced from several hundred to under ten.

Semantic constraints written on semantic markers indicate the plausible case structure. Different sets of semantic markers are chosen according to the purpose. A priority evaluation scheme steers the analysis towards the most plausible structure first, without trying all possibilities.
- Yiming Yang, T. Nishida, S. Doshita. 1984. Use of Heuristic Knowledge in Chinese Language Analysis. Abstract: This paper describes an analysis method which uses heuristic knowledge to find local syntactic structures of Chinese sentences. We call it a preprocessing, because we use it before we do global syntactic structure analysis (1) of the input sentence. Our purpose is to guide the global analysis through the search space, to avoid unnecessary computation.To realize this, we use a set of special words that appear in commonly used patterns in Chinese. We call them "characteristic words". They enable us to pick out fragments that might figure in the syntactic structure of the sentence. Knowledge concerning the use of characteristic words enables us to rate alternative fragments, according to pattern statistics, fragment length, distance between characteristic words, and so on. The preprocessing system proposes to the global analysis level a most "likely" partial structure. In case this choice is rejected, backtracking looks for a second choice, and so on.For our system, we use 200 characteristic words. Their rules are written by 101 automata. We tested them against 120 sentences taken from a Chinese physics text book. For this limited set, correct partial structures were proposed as first choice for 94% of sentences. Allowing a 2nd choice, the score is 98%, with a 3rd choice, the score is 100%.

Abstract: Recently, an increasing interest has been put on spectrally-efficient multi-carrier superchannels for beyond 100G. Apart from orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) and Nyquist wavelength-division multiplexing (WDM), another low-complexity WDM approach based on transmitter-side pre-filtering and receiver-side duobinary shaping is proposed to build up multi-carrier superchannels. This approach is referred to as receiver-side duobinary-shaped WDM (RS-DBS-WDM). Generation and transmission of a 1.232-Tbit/s 11-carrier superchannel is experimentally demonstrated. The superchannel signal can be well fit inside the passband of multiple 300-GHz reconfigurable optical add and drop multiplexers (ROADMs). In the superchannel scenario, the proposed RS-DBS-WDM is qualitatively compared with OFDM and Nyquist-WDM in terms of implementation complexity. In sum, the proposed RS-DBS-WDM approach features high transceiver analog-bandwidth efficiency, high spectral-efficiency, the absence of specific spectral manipulation, compatibility with conventional WDM technologies and coherent detection algorithms, and comparable implementation penalty.

Chapter 5 Multi-strategy Learning for Topic Detection and Tracking A joint report of eMU approaches to multilingual TDT. Abstract: This chapter reports on eMU's work in all the five TDT-1999 tasks, including segmentation (story boundary identification), topic tracking, topic detection, first story detection, and story-link detection. We have addressed these tasks as supervised or unsupervised classification problems, and applied a variety of statistical learning algorithms to each problem for comparison. For segmentation we used exponential language models and decision trees; for topic tracking we used primarily k-nearest-neighbors classification (also language models, decision trees and a variant of the Rocchio approach); for topic detection we used a combination of incremental clustering and agglomerative hierarchical clustering, and for first story detection and story link detection we used a cosine-similarity based measure. We also studied the effect of combining the output of alternative methods for producing joint classification decisions in topic tracking. We found that a combined use of multiple methods typically improved the classification of new topics when compared to using any single method. We examined our approaches with multi-lingual corpora, including stories in English, Mandarin and Spanish, and multi-media corpora consisting of newswire texts and the results of automated speech recognition for broadcast news sources. The methods worked reasonably well under all of the above conditions.
